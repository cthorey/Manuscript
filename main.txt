Formation, transport et stockage des magmas
Formation

Sur Terre, la majorite des magmas sont formes par fusion partielle des roches
du manteau superieur. Dans les conditions normales de pression, la temperature du manteau superieur n'est pourtant pas suffisante pour provoquer leur
fusion (Figure 1.1) et d'autres mecanismes sont necessaires pour amener les
roches du manteau a croiser leur liquidus. Au niveau des dorsales en contexte
oceanique ou des rifts en contexte continental ou encore au sein des panaches
mantelliques, la fusion partielle est ainsi generee par decompression (Figure
1.1 b). Au niveau des zones de subduction, les mecanismes mis en jeu sont

6

Chapter 1. Magmatisme intrusif

plus complexes et font intervenir la deshydratation par chauffage des roches
et la migration des fluides abaissant le liquidus et provoquant ainsi la fusion
des roches alentour (Figure 1.1 c).

1.1.2

Transport

Les liquides de fusions ainsi formes sont moins denses que les roches alentours
et s'elevent donc, par compaction et percolation, au sein de la source (McKenzie, 1984, 1985). Le transport du magma depuis la source jusqu'au couches
superficielles de la lithosphere a longtemps etait l'objet de debat (Clemens

1.1. Formation, transport et stockage des magmas

7

and Mawer , 1992; Miller and Paterson, 1999). Cependant, les modeles de
gros volumes diapiriques de magma remontant lentement au sein de la lithosphere, invoques traditionnellement notamment pour expliquer la presence de
gros volumes de magma intrudes au sein de la croute a l'erosion ( dans la vallee
du Yosemite aux Etats-Unis par exemple), sont maintenant en desaveux. En
effet, il est maintenant admis que ces gros volumes se sont mis en place par
increment successif de magmas et que celui ci est transporte depuis la source
rapidement au sein de le croute au sein de chenaux verticaux, i.e. de dykes
ou le long de failles preexistantes (Clemens and Mawer , 1992; Petford et al.,
1993; Rubin, 1995; Glazner et al., 2004).

1.1.3

Stockage

Les travaux de Walker (1989) ont montre que les magmas remontent jusqu'a
rencontrer leur zone de flottabilite neutre, une region ou la densite de la roche
encaissante est proche de celle du magma lui-meme. En effet, au-dessus de
cette couche, le magma est plus dense que la roche encaissante et sa flottabilite
l'entraine vers le bas. De nombreux travaux, tant theoriques (Lister and Kerr ,
1991; Petford et al., 1993; Rubin, 1995) qu'experimentaux (Taisne and Tait,
2009; Taisne et al., 2011) ont en effet depuis montre que l'ascension d'un dyke
etait controlee par la difference de densite entre la tete de celui-ci et la roche
encaissante. Lorsque le dyke entre dans une region de densite inferieure, la
souspression induite peut, sous certaines conditions, conduire a l'etalement du
magma au niveau de la base de la region de plus faible densite permettant ainsi
la formation de reservoir magmatique sous forme d'intrusion magmatique au
sein de la croute (Taisne et al., 2011).
Plus recemment, d'autres etudes ont montre que les contrastes de rigidite entre les differentes couches crustales pourraient aussi jouer un role non
negligeable sur l'arret de l'ascension des dykes (Menand , 2011). En effet, des
experiences realisees par Kavanagh et al. (2006) ont montre que la propagation d'un dyke peut etre arretee quand celui-ci rencontre une interface qui
separe un milieu plus rigide surplombant un milieu moins rigide (Figure 1.2).
Le dyke arrete ainsi son ascension verticale et s'etale horizontalement juste
en dessous de la couche de rigidite plus elevee. Ce mecanisme serait d'autant
plus efficace que le contraste de rigidite est important (Kavanagh et al., 2006).
Finalement, les contraintes, locales ou globales, peuvent aussi devier la
trajectoire d'un dyke et influencer les trajets des magmas au sein de la croute.
En effet, de nombreuses etudes ont montres que les chenaux par lesquels se
propage le magma tendent a s'orienter perpendiculairement a la contrainte
minimum de compression (Anderson, 1951; Watanabe et al., 2002). Les dykes
ont donc tendance a exister dans des situations dans lesquelles la contrainte

Chapter 1. Magmatisme intrusif

Figure 1.2: a) Photographie de deux des experiences realisees par Kavanagh
et al. (2006) sur le comportement d'un dyke a l'interface entre deux milieux
de rigidite differente. a) Le contraste de rigidite est tres important et le dyke
s'etale sous la couche de rigidite importante. b) Le contraste de rigidite est
plus faible et, tout en s'etalant en dessous de la couche de rigidite superieure,

minimum de compression est horizontales et a etre devie, voir meme s'etaler
horizontalement si la contrainte minimum de compression devient verticale
(Pinel and Jaupart, 2000, 2004; Maccaferri et al., 2014). Menand et al. (2010)
ont cependant montre que l'echelle de longueur sur laquelle le dyke repondait a
cette evolution du champ de contrainte dependait de la flotabilite du magma.
Notamment, a l'echelle de la croute, la propension d'un champ de contrainte a
devier un dyke devient importante seulement si la contrainte de compression
domine sur la flotabilite du magma (Menand et al., 2010).
En conclusion, meme si ces differents facteurs jouent un role sur le controle
des trajets des magmas au sein de la croute, la densite relative du magma et
de la roche encaissante et donc l'existence d'une zone de flottabilite neutre est
certainement le facteur le plus determinant dans la mise en place d'intrusions
magmatiques. Le magmatisme intrusif et la question du stockage des magmas,
est donc de maniere generale etroitement lie a la structure en densite de la
croute elle-meme.

Importance et multiples visages du magmatisme intrusif
Magmatisme intrusif sur Terre

Sur Terre, la composition de la croute, et donc sa densite, est bimodale. Au
niveau des oceans, la croute oceanique presente une nature essentiellement

1.2. Importance et multiples visages du magmatisme intrusif

basaltique avec une densite moyenne proche de 2900 kg m-3 . Elle est formee
continuellement au niveau des dorsales oceaniques et recyclee, environ 200
Ma d'annee plus tard au niveau des zones de subduction. Elle est epaisse
en moyenne de 6 km et couvre a elle seule 70% de la surface du globe. Au
contraire, la croute continentale, qui occupe les 30% restants, presente une
composition plus evoluee et globalement andesitique avec une densite moyenne
plus proche de 2700 kg m-3 . Elle est beaucoup plus vieille que la croute
oceanique et est agee en moyenne de 2.5 Ga, avec certaines roches d'environ 4
Ga d'annees. Elle est aussi beaucoup plus epaisse que la croute continentale;
son epaisseur moyenne est de 35 km et peut exceder les 70 kilometres sous
certaines chaines de montagnes comme l'Himalaya.
De par sa densite relativement basse, en particulier au niveau des continents, la croute constitue un filtre efficace a la remontee des magmas en surface
qui sont donc preferentiellement stockes en profondeur sous forme d'intrusions
magmatiques. Crisp (1984) et White et al. (2006) estiment en effet que les
volumes de lave extrudee a la surface sont relativement faibles en comparaison
des volumes mis en place au sein de la croute terrestre, i.e. 5 fois plus faibles
en contexte oceanique et jusqu'a 10 fois plus faibles en contexte continental.
Le magmatisme intrusif apparait donc comme un processus essentiel dans la
formation de la croute. Sur Terre, les mouvements tectoniques en son sein
ainsi que l'erosion ont permis d'exposer certaines de ces intrusions a la surface. Outre leur taille, qui peut varier de quelques metres a des centaines de
kilometres, la morphologie de ces intrusions presente une grande variabilite.
Les batholites sont de loin les plus imposants representants de cette famille
d'intrusions magmatiques se mettant en place au sein de la partie fragile de
la croute. Ils peuvent atteindre jusqu'a quelques kilometres d'epaisseur et
s'etendre sur des centaines de kilometres. Par exemple, le batholite de la Sierra
Nevada est une intrusion granitique qui s'etend sur presque la totalite de la
Sierra Nevada en Californie. Des donnees geochronologiques sur certains de
ces batholites ont montre que leur mise en place peut s'echelonner sur quelques
millions d'annees, un temps beaucoup plus grand que les temps raisonnables
pour le refroidissement d'une chambre magmatique dans la partie fragile de la
croute (Glazner et al., 2004). En effet, il est maintenant clair que la mise en
place de ces gigantesques volumes de magmas se fait par increments successifs
de petits volumes de magma se solidifiant lors de leur mise en place sur de
longues echelles de temps, de 105 a 106 annees (Petford et al., 2000; Glazner
et al., 2004). Dans cette these, nous nous focalisons sur les mecanismes de
formation et de mise en place de volumes intermediaires de magma dans la
partie fragile de la croute continentale, a des profondeurs inferieures a 10 km.
Des etudes geologiques de terrain ont montre la presence de quatre grandes
familles d'intrusions magmatiques de taille intermediaire a faible profondeur.

Deux de ces familles, les dykes et les bysmalites, sont discordantes, c'est-a-dire
qu'elles se mettent en place perpendiculairement a la stratification naturelle
de l'encaissant et deux autres, les sills et les laccolites, sont concordantes, i.e.
elles se mettent en place parallelement aux couches geologiques.

* Les dykes, par lesquels remontent le magma a travers la lithosphere sont
discordants et caracterises par de faibles rapports d'aspects, de 0.01 -
0.0001 (Figure 1.3, 1.4 a) (Rubin, 1995; Schultz et al., 2008; Kavanagh
and Sparks, 2011). Leur epaisseur peut varier de quelques metres a
quelques centaines de metres (Walker , 1989; Krumbholz et al., 2014),
cependant, l'epaisseur moyenne est de quelques dizaines de metres. Les
dykes de compositions felsiques sont generalement plus epais et moins
longs que leurs equivalents mafiques (Rubin, 1995).
* Les sills, a la difference des dykes, sont concordants (Figure 1.3, 1.4
b,f). Ils se mettent en place le long de discontinuites ou de failles preexistantes, a la jonction entre deux couches sedimentaires par exemple.
Les sills aux dimensions les plus importantes repertories sont mafiques
et peuvent attendre jusqu'a 100 km pour des epaisseurs de plusieurs
centaines de metres (Cruden et al., 2012). Leurs homologues felsiques,
plus rares, sont souvent de dimensions plus faibles.

(Figure 1.4 c, d, e). Ils se mettent en place principalement par flexion des
couches sedimentaires sus-jacentes, ce qui leur donne une forme de dome
caracteristique. Certains d'entre eux peuvent aussi etre caracterises par
une forme un peu plus aplatie au centre (Koch et al., 1981). Corry
(1988) a repertorie a peu pres 900 laccolites, principalement dans le
nord des Etats-Unis. Leurs epaisseurs varient de quelques dizaines a
quelques centaines de metres et leurs rayons peuvent atteindre quelques
kilometres pour les plus gros (Figure 1.3 b). Ces laccolites se sont parfois
mis en place les uns sur les autres formant une structure en forme de
sapin de Noel (Corry, 1988). Cette geometrie est aussi observee sur l'ile
d'Elbe, en Italie, ou un complexe de neuf laccolites, exceptionnellement
bien conserve, a ete etudie en detail par Rocchi et al. (2002).
* Les bysmalites sont d'imposants volumes cylindriques, preferentiellement composes de roche granitique, discordants (Figure 1.4 f). Ils sont
notamment bordes par d'importantes failles presque verticales et peuvent atteindre quelques centaines de metres d'epaisseur (Johnson and
Pollard , 1973). Un exemple typique de ce type d'intrusion est le Black
Mesa Bysmalite dans les Henry Mountains (200 m d'epaisseur et 1 km
de large (Morgan et al., 2008)).

A l'instar des batholites, de nombreuses observations de terrains proposent
que ces intrusions de taille moyenne se forment aussi par increments successifs
de petits volumes de magma (Habert and De Saint-Blanquat, 2004; Horsman
et al., 2005; Morgan et al., 2008) (Figure 1.5). Cependant, les memes etudes
montrent aussi que ces intrusions se forment necessairement sur de petites
echelles de temps, des echelles assez faibles pour pouvoir garder un corps
chaud et liquide des premieres etapes du processus d'intrusion a la solidification. Au niveau du bysmalite de Black Mesa par exemple (Figure 1.4 f),
Habert and De Saint-Blanquat (2004) ont montre l'absence de discontinuites
entre les differentes couches ainsi que l'absence de metamorphisme important dans l'encaissant indiquant un temps de mise en place de moins de 100
ans. L'absence de discontinuite au sein des differents laccolites sur l'ile d'Elbe
supporte aussi leur formation rapide, i.e. a la suite d'une seule injection ou
de plusieurs injections sur un temps assez court pour que les magmas des
differentes injections coalescent (Roni et al., 2014).

Magmatisme intrusif sur la Lune

millier d'annees pour former notre satellite (Mizutani et al., 1972; Cameron
and Benz , 1991; Canup and Asphaug, 2001; Canup, 2012). Compte tenu des
quantites importantes d'energie liberee durant le processus d'accretion, on
considere aujourd'hui que la Lune etait partiellement fondue, sur une epaisseur encore debattue, suite a sa formation (Elkins-Tanton et al., 2011). Le
refroidissement et la lente cristallisation fractionnee de l'ocean de magma lunaire aurait ensuite conduit a la formation d'une croute primaire par flottaison
des mineraux legers de plagioclase (en particulier du pole calcique, l'anorthite)
a la surface de l'ocean de magma tandis que les elements les plus incompatibles, en particulier les elements producteurs de chaleur, se seraient concentres
dans les derniers liquides magmatiques residuels entre la croute et le manteau,
forme, lui, principalement de cumulats d'olivine et de pyroxene (Figure 1.6).

Chapter 1. Magmatisme intrusif

Etant donne sa composition et la porosite resultante de 4 milliards d'annees
de bombardement meteoritiques, la densite de la croute lunaire est particulierement faible (Huang and Wieczorek , 2012; Han et al., 2014). D'apres
les dernieres estimations, rendues possibles grace aux mesures du champ de
gravite d'une resolution sans precedent obtenues par la mission GRAIL de la
NASA, la densite moyenne au niveau des terres hautes serait de 2550 kg m-3
(Wieczorek et al., 2013). Ces donnees ont aussi permis de reevaluer a la baisse
l'epaisseur de la croute a entre 34 et 44 km en moyenne avec une tendance a
etre moins epaisse au niveau des mers lunaires.
La faible densite de sa croute et son epaisseur non negligeable ont certainement joue un role important sur le volcanisme lunaire. En effet, les magmas
formees par fusion du manteau lunaire sont particulierement dense, de l'ordre
de 3000 kg m-3 (Kiefer et al., 2012) en lien avec leur composition basaltique
riche en oxydes metalliques, en particulier en oxyde de Fer F eO et de Titane Ti O2 . Ainsi, la croute primaire formee par cristallisation de l'ocean de
magma etant tres legere, elle a sans aucun doute aussi ete un filtre puissant
a l'eruption des magmas sur la lune, leur flottabilite ne leur permettant pas
d'etre transporte jusqu'a la surface.
Wieczorek et al. (2001) ont ainsi confirme que le volcanisme a la surface est
generalement lie a l'extraction d'une partie de cette croute de faible densite,
comme c'est la cas par exemple des mers lunaires qui se sont mises en place
au sein de larges bassins d'impacts. Head and Wilson (1992) ont estime a
50 fois plus importants les volumes de magma mis en place en profondeur
que les volumes eruptes en surface. Cependant, bien que ce rapport puisse
donner de precieuses indications sur l'evolution thermique et magmatique de
la lune elle-meme, il est de fait tres peu contraint et la part intrusive du
magmatisme lunaire est encore mal connue. La detection des deformations
de surface induites par la mise en place d'intrusions magmatiques au sein
de la croute apparait donc comme une premiere etape visant a la meilleur
caracterisation du magmatisme intrusif lunaire.
Deux manifestations principales a la surface de la lune ont ete proposees
comme potentiellement resultantes de la mise en place d'intrusions magmatiques au sein de la croute lunaire: les domes a faible pente et les crateres a
sol fracture.
* Les domes a faible pente sont localises en bordure ou dans les mers lunaires, principalement sur la face visible (Figure 1.8 a, b). Une quinzaine
de ces domes, possiblement d'origine intrusive, ont ete recemment decrit
par Wohler et al. (2007). Bien que leur morphologie s'apparente a des
laccolites terrestres, ils sont de maniere generale beaucoup plus etales
que ceux sur Terre; pour une meme epaisseur, l'equivalent lunaire peut

ainsi etre deux fois plus large que son homologue terrestre.
* Les crateres a sol fracture sont des crateres d'impacts ayant subi des deformations suite a leur formation. A peu pres 200 de ces crateres ont ete
repertorie par Schultz (1976a), principalement autour des mers lunaires
(Figure 1.8 c, d, e, f). La principale caracteristique de ces crateres est
leur faible profondeur par rapport a celles des crateres non deformes. En
effet, certains crateres au sol fracture peuvent etre jusqu'a 2 km moins
profonds que leurs homologues non deformes. Leur sol, soit en forme
de dome, soit plat separe des bords du cratere par un imposant fosse
circulaire, est systematiquement caracterise par d'importants reseaux de
fractures radiales, concentriques ou encore pentagonales (Figure 1.8 c,

Schultz (1976a) a postule l'existence de six grandes classes de deformation. La proximite de ces crateres avec les mers lunaires, ainsi que la
presence de produits volcaniques au sein de certains d'entre eux, suggere
qu'ils ont ete deformes suite a la mise en place de magma en profondeur
sous leur sol.

1.3.1

Caracterisation de la mise en place d'une
intrusion magmatique a faible profondeur
Modele statique de deformation d'une couche elastique

Bien que la morphologie et les volumes de magma puissent etre recuperes, a
partir d'observations directes ou de methodes de prospection geophysique sur
Terre ou via les deformations induites a la surface des autres corps telluriques
du systeme solaire, ces informations seules ne donnent que peu d'indications
sur les mecanismes de mise en place de ces intrusions magmatiques. De nombreux travaux ont ainsi ete centres sur la modelisation des processus donnant lieu a ces deformations, dans le but de mieux comprendre le mecanisme
d'intrusion d'une part, mais aussi, de deduire des observations des informations sur le magma, les parametres mecaniques de l'encaissant ou encore la
profondeur de l'intrusion au moment de sa mise en place.
La propagation d'un dyke dans un milieu elastique a ete beaucoup etudiee
(Lister and Kerr , 1991; Rubin, 1995). En particulier, Lister and Kerr (1991)
ont montre que, a l'exception de la tete du dyke ou les contraintes elastiques
induites par les roches encaissantes jouent un role important, la dynamique du
magma au sein du dyke est controlee par un equilibre entre la flottabilite et les
pertes de charge associees aux frottements visqueux sur les parois du conduit.
On a vu qu'un dyke peut se transformer en sill si celui-ci rencontre sa zone de
flottabilite neutre. Bien que la dynamique des dykes et des sills soit comparable a forte profondeur (Lister and Kerr , 1991; Cruden et al., 2012), a faible
profondeur, la forme des laccolites suppose que les intrusions magmatiques se
mettent en place principalement par flexion des couches sus-jacentes (Johnson
and Pollard , 1973). Une pratique, courante en science planetaire, consiste a
modeliser ces laccolites par la deformation d'une plaque mince elastique, de
longueur fixee et egale a la taille de l'intrusion, soumise a une pression donnee
(Pollard and Johnson, 1973). Dans ces modeles statiques, cette pression, donnant lieu a la deformation, est soit prise constante sur la taille de l'intrusion et
egale au poids du magma (Pollard and Johnson, 1973; Wichman and Schultz ,
1996; Jozwiak et al., 2012), soit imposee suivant un profil decrivant la perte

18

Chapter 1. Magmatisme intrusif

de charge associee a un ecoulement visqueux (Kerr and Pollard , 1998; Wohler
et al., 2009). Cependant, dans aucun des cas, cette pression n'est reliee aux
parametres de l'ecoulement lui-meme, i.e. volume ou taux d'injection. De
plus, ces modeles ne fournissent pas un cadre theorique suffisant a la comprehension de la dynamique de l'intrusion et sont donc incapables d'expliquer
la diversite des formes et des tailles observees. Enfin, ils considerent la flexion
de la couche sus-jacente comme unique pression motrice a l'ecoulement, sans
considerer le poids du magma lui-meme, qui doit pourtant necessairement
jouer un role sur la mise en place de l'intrusion.

1.3.2

Inference sur la dynamique a partir de la geometrie

En l'absence d'un modele dynamique, la geometrie des intrusions repertoriees
a souvent ete utilisee pour en deduire des indications sur les processus de mise
en place et de croissance de ces intrusions. Ainsi, en utilisant les donnees
repertoriees sur les laccolites par Corry (1988), McCaffrey and Petford (1997)
proposent une loi de puissance empirique pour l'epaisseur des intrusions h0 en
fonction de leur longueur R, h0 = bRa ou a est l'exposant de la loi de puissance
et b une constante. Un exposant superieur a l'unite indique que l'intrusion
croit preferentiellement en s'epaississant tandis qu'un exposant inferieur a
l'unite indique qu'elle croit plutot par etalement.

(0.88  0.1), interprete comme refletant l'etalement de l'intrusion sur une certaine distance sous forme d'un sill avant son epaississement (Figure 1.9). Ce
modele est coherent avec le modele en deux etapes couramment accepte pour
la mise en place des laccolites (Johnson and Pollard , 1973; McCaffrey and
Petford , 1997). Premierement, le magma s'etale lateralement au niveau de sa
zone de flottabilite neutre , i.e. a < 1 jusqu'a ce qu'un sill, caracterise par
un rapport d'aspect assez large, soit forme. Ensuite, lorsque le sill est assez
large, il s'epaissit par flexion des couches sus-jacentes pour former un laccolite
caracterise par une valeur de a > 1 (Johnson and Pollard , 1973; Koch et al.,
1981). Si la roche sus-jacente est soumise a des contraintes trop importantes,
des failles se forment au niveau des bords du sill et celui-ci s'epaissit uniformement sur toute sa surface formant un bysmalite (Corry, 1988). Dans la
continuite de l'etude de McCaffrey and Petford (1997), Rocchi et al. (2002)
ont realise une etude detaillee du complexe intrusif de l'ile d'Elbe en Italie
et ont trouve un exposant a superieur a l'unite, i.e.  1.5, interprete comme
etant la preuve de l'existence d'une phase dominee par l'epaississement de
l'intrusion dans la croissance de ces laccolites.
Des modeles plus recents concoivent plutot la formation des laccolites par
empilements successifs de sills, de grand rapport d'aspect, plutot que par
l'injection d'un seul volume de magma fini a un temps donne (Menand , 2011).
En effet, ces modeles sont etayes par les experiences de Kavanagh et al. (2006)
(Section 1.1.3) ou il est montre qu'un sill peut se mettre en place a l'interface
entre deux couches de rigidite differentes, la rigidite de la couche sus-jacente
etant plus importante que celle de la couche sous-jacente. Des lors, la mise
en place d'un sill, en refroidissant, procure un environnement favorable a la
mise en place d'un nouveau sill, soit au-dessus si la rigidite du sill solidifie est
inferieure a celle de la roche sus-jacente, soit en dessous dans le cas contraire.
Ce modele de croissance a aussi ete suggere par de recentes etudes structurales
et stratigraphiques, notamment au niveau des intrusions de tailles intermediaires dans les Henry Mountains (Horsman et al., 2005; Morgan et al., 2008;
Horsman et al., 2009; Menand , 2011). Ce modele, a la difference des modeles
statiques exposes plus haut, a aussi l'avantage de pouvoir expliquer la structure aplatie au niveau du centre de certains laccolites (Morgan et al., 2008).
Cependant, ce modele ne fournit pas de mecanisme ni ne permet d'expliquer
l'origine de la loi de puissance caracteristique de la geometrie de ces intrusions. De plus, il ne permet pas de relier la geometrie finale de l'intrusion aux
proprietes physiques de l'ecoulement (volume, taux d'injection).
Cruden and McCaffrey (2002) ont reuni des donnees sur une plus grande
plage de longueurs, de petits filons de quelques dizaines de metres a des
batholites de quelques centaines de kilometres (Figure 1.9) et proposent que
l'epaisseur en fonction de la longueur des intrusions magmatiques forme une

20

Chapter 1. Magmatisme intrusif

distribution en forme de sigmoide (dans une echelle logarithmique), avec une
pente maximum de 1.5 caracteristique des laccolites. Cependant, aucune
theorie sous-jacente ne soutient cette observation. De plus, les donnees de
Cruden et al. (2012) sur les larges sills mafiques contredisent cette affirmation
(Figure 1.3).

1.3.3

Discussion

Bien que de nombreux modeles ont ete proposes pour essayer de rendre compte
des observations, peu d'entre eux s'interessent a la dynamique de l'intrusion
qui permettrait cependant de relier la morphologie de ces intrusions aux proprietes physiques de l'ecoulement (volume ou taux d'injection). Afin de comprendre la morphologie des intrusions peu profondes, il apparait donc important de s'interesser a la dynamique d'un tel ecoulement.
Michaut (2011) a ainsi propose un modele theorique d'etalement d'un
magma visqueux sous une couche elastique d'epaisseur contante continuellement nourrie par un conduit vertical en son centre. Ce modele differe des
precedents par sa capacite a traiter la dynamique meme de l'intrusion ainsi
que le poids du magma comme un moteur de l'ecoulement. Les resultats et
la capacite de ce modele a reproduire les observations sont discutes dans le
chapitre suivant.

Michaut (2011) proposed a model for the spreading of a shallow depth
intermediate-size intrusion, in which magma is continuously injected at the
center and is accommodated by the bending of the overlying strata. In particular, the model differs from previous ones by considering both the dynamics
of the emplacement itself, in a sense that the radius is self-consistently determined, and the driving force associated with the magma weight. Both were
neglected in previous models. In the original paper from Michaut (2011), the
model was derived in both cartesian and axisymmetric geometry and the results were presented in 2D. A similar model in 2D with an additional fracture

Chapter 2. Isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current model for

criterion at the tip of the intrusion has been derived by Bunger and Cruden
(2011) and Hewitt et al. (2014) discussed more precisely the dynamics at the
contact line and the case of an elastic-plated gravity current spreading over
an inclined plane. In this chapter, we present a summary of the model and
the results for the spreading of an isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current
over a rigid horizontal surface in an axisymmetrical geometry. Results in this
geometry have been thoroughly studied by Lister et al. (2013) and this will
constitute the reference for more elaborate models in the manuscript.

2.1

Theoretical model

The model considers an isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current, i.e. an isoviscous fluid of viscosity h and density m spreading beneath a thin elastic
sheet of thickness dc and above a semi infinite rigid layer (Michaut, 2011;
Bunger and Cruden, 2011) (Figure 2.1). The fluid is injected continuously at
the base and center of the current at a rate Q0 through a cylindrical conduit
of diameter a.

where u(r, z, t) is the radial velocity, g is the standard acceleration due to
gravity and P (r, z, t) is the pressure within the fluid. Integration of (2.2)
thus gives the total pressure P (r, z, t) within the flow. When the vertical
deflection h(r, t) of the upper elastic layer is small compared to its thickness
dc , i.e h << dc , we can neglect stretching of the upper layer and only consider
bending stresses. Therefore, the total pressure P (r, z, t) at a level z in the
intrusion is the sum of four contributions: the weight of the magma and of
the upper layer, the bending pressure Pb and the atmospheric pressure P0
P = m g(h - z) + r gdc + Pb + P0

(2.3)

where h(r, t) is the intrusion thickness and r the density of the surrounding rocks. The bending pressure is given by the force per unit area that is
necessary for a vertical displacement h of the thin elastic plate (Turcotte and
Schubert, 1982)
Pd = D4r h
(2.4)
where D is the flexural rigidity of the thin elastic layer, that depends on the
Young's modulus E, Poisson's ratio   and on the elastic layer thickness dc as
D = Ed3c / (12(1 -  2 )).
Velocity field
At the contact with the elastic sheet z = h(r, t), the no-slip boundary
condition hold; the tangential velocity is zero and the normal velocity is the
rate of height change (h/t). With ~n the normal to the surface and ~t the
tangent, we have
h

~t * ~u = 0

~n * ~u =

(2.6)

The tangent vector is ~t = (1, h/r). However, within the lubrication assumption, the vertical component of the tangent vector scales as  and thus,
is negligible compared to the radial component. Therefore, the boundary condition (2.6) reduces to u(r, z = h, t) = 0. At the base of the flow, the same
boundary condition holds and u(r, z = 0, t) = 0.

2.1.3

Need for regularization

One of the main mathematical difficulty in solving equation (2.15) arises at
the contact line between the rigid support and the elastic plate. Indeed,
the assumption that the thickness of the fluid tends to zero at the contact
line leads to divergent viscous stresses, i.e. h u/z   and hence, the
theoretical immobility of the blister (Flitton and King, 2004; Lister et al.,
2013; Hewitt et al., 2014). This problem, known as the contact-line paradox,
is a well know problem for surface-tension driven flow such as the spreading
of a water droplet (Bertozzi, 1998; Snoeijer and Andreotti, 2013).
The formal proof has been given by Flitton and King (2004) and can be
derived as follow. Suppose that (2.15) has a solution and the solution near

26

the contact line has the form
h  A(t)(R(t) - r)

(2.16)

As r  R(t), the bending term dominates the gravitational term and (2.15)

Given that A > 0, this shows that (2.15) can only have solutions with retreating contact line (dR/dt < 0) but not with advancing contact line (dR/dt > 0)
(Lister et al., 2013; Flitton and King, 2004).
To mitigate this problem, one common approach is to add a thin prewetting
film, with thickness hf such that h  hf as r   (Figure 2.1). While the
solution will depend upon the prewetting film thickness hf and will not show
any convergence properties when hf  0, we will see that the dependence in
hf is weak and the difference between different values for hf will be relatively
small (Lister et al., 2013; Hewitt et al., 2014). Unless otherwise specified,
we will often consider hf = 5 * 10-3 in the manuscript which represents the
smallest length scale with a physical meaning (Section 2.3.1).

2.2

Results

For a small prewetting film thickness, i.e. hf << 1, the numerical resolution
of the equation (2.15) shows two or three asymptotic spreading regimes: a
bending regime where gravity is negligible, a viscous gravity current regime
where bending is negligible or a regime of lateral propagation if the weight of
the magma at the center compensates for the initial overpressure (Michaut,
2011; Bunger and Cruden, 2011; Lister et al., 2013). In the following, we
present the shape of the flow as well as scaling laws that predict the evolution
of the thickness at the center h0 (t) and the radius R(t) in each regime.

and one needs to multiply by the characteristic scales (thickness, length or
time given by (2.13), (2.12) or (2.14)) to obtain dimensional values. For
t < 10, the intrusion is in the bending regime whereas for t > 10 the intrusion
is in the gravity current regime.

2.2.1

Bending regime

At early times, when R << , gravity is negligible and the dynamics of
the spreading is governed by the bending of the upper layer. In addition, if
h0 << , the overpressure P driving the flow is much larger than the weight
of the blister at the center and the injection rate can be considered constant.
In that case, the spreading is very slow and the interior has uniform dimensionless pressure P = 4r h. The flow is bell-shaped and its thickness is
given by

with h0 (t) the thickness of the intrusion at the center (Figure 2.2, t < 10)
(Michaut, 2011; Lister et al., 2013). In this regime, Lister et al. (2013) have
shown that the spreading is controlled by the propagation of a peeling by

(Figure 1.4 c, d, e) (Michaut, 2011).

2.2.2

Gravity current regime

In contrast, when the radius R becomes larger than  4, the weight of
the intrusion becomes dominant over the bending terms. The dimensionless
pressure is given by the hydrostatic pressure P = h and the intrusion enters
a classical viscous gravity current regime where bending terms only affect
the solution near the intrusion edge (Figure 2.2, t > 10) (Huppert, 1982a;
Michaut, 2011; Lister et al., 2013). In this second regime, while the thickness
tends to be a constant, the radius evolves as t1/2 (Figure 2.3). The flow is

2.3. Application to the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions
29
therefore characterized by a small aspect-ratio h0 /R and a constant thickness
disk-like morphology close to the one shown by large mafic sills (Figure 1.4
a).
In between the bending and gravity regime, Lister et al. (2013) also describe a short intermediate regime where the peeling by bending continues to
control the propagation but where, due to the increasing effect of gravity, the
flow shows an interior flat-topped region (Figure 2.2, t = 38). This flat-topped
morphology is also observed for many laccoliths (Koch et al., 1981; Bunger
and Cruden, 2011).
Therefore, the model is able to reproduce the variety of shapes of intermediate scale magmatic intrusions: from the dome shape and flat topped
morphology of laccolith to the disk-like morphology of large mafic sills. In the
following, we quantitatively compare the model predictions to some observations on terrestrial planets.

Observations versus predictions on Earth

Observations
Corry (1988) has made an extensive catalog of 900 laccoliths across the world.
In particular, Corry (1988) provides the thickness and the radius of 168 laccoliths. For 40 of them, he gives an estimate for the intrusion depth. These
laccoliths, who are mainly felsic in composition, show thicknesses that range
from 100 meters to 1 km with radii in between 1 and 10 km (Figure 2.5 a).
While most of the data are located in the United State ( 90%), the different
laccoliths are widely spread among the territory and variations in the flow
parameters between different laccoliths are most likely to be important.
In addition to the data from Corry (1988), we also consider in this study
the data provided by Rocchi et al. (2002) on 9 laccoliths nested in a christmas
tree structure at Elba Island, Italy (Figure 2.4). The detailed mapping and
reconstruction of tectonic history made by Rocchi et al. (2002) provides for
the parameters of each intrusive layer in the laccolith complex. In addition,
for this dataset, each laccolith is part of a larger intrusive system, and hence
variability of the model parameters should be limited, except for the overlying
elastic layer thickness, assumed to be the intrusion depth in the model, whose
variation between laccoliths is given by Rocchi et al. (2002). The dispersion
is much smaller for this dataset; the radius ranges from 800 m to 5 km and

the thickness from 50 m to 700 m (Figure 2.5 a).
Finally, we also show the morphology of 25 large mafic sills whose thicknesses and radii are given by Cruden et al. (2012) (Figure 2.5 a). In order to
account for the intrinsic scale of different settings for each intrusion and compare them to the model, the data have first to be nondimensionalized using
characteristic values for each intrusion parameters and also their depth, when
absent from the catalog.
Range of values for the parameters
In terrestrial settings, magma density m mainly depends on its composition
and varies between 2500 kg m-3 for felsic magmas to 2900 kg m-3 for more
mafic magmas. Reported intrusion depths vary from 180 to 2200 m for laccoliths in Corry (1988) and from 1.9 to 3.7 km for laccoliths at Elba Island.
Hence, for a Young's modulus value of 10 GPa, the characteristic length scale
 varies between  1 km and  7 km for laccoliths. The density does not
affect much the value of  and the characteristic length scale for large mafic
sills, whose depths are not reported in Cruden et al. (2012) and set to 1.5 km,

is equal to  3 km.
On Earth, laccoliths are generally formed by relatively evolved lavas that
may have differentiated from primitive magma in deep crustal magma chambers, located some 5 to 15 km below the surface. The overpressures driving
magma ascent are typically 20 to 50 MPa (Stasiuk et al., 1993; Barmin et al.,
2002), which gives overpressure gradients of  103 Pa m-1 . Lava viscosity at
eruption temperature h mainly depends on its composition and water content; close to its liquidus temperature, it can vary from 102 Pa s for mafic lavas
to 106 Pa s for felsic lavas (Shaw , 1972; Giordano et al., 2008; Whittington
et al., 2009; Chevrel et al., 2013). However, Wada (1994) shows that the dyke
width tends to increase with viscosity to the power 1/4 (Kerr and Lister ,
1995) and overall, the injection rate Q0 should be similar for different magma
compositions. Based on common effusion rate for lava flows on Earth, we take
Q0  0.1 - 100 m3 s-1 (Pieri and Baloga, 1986; Harris et al., 2000; Castro
et al., 2013; Tuffen et al., 2013). The height scale H thus varies between  1
to 10 m for felsic laccoliths and  0.1 and 1 m for large mafic sills.

The model also considers a thin prewetting film of thickness hf whose
meaning in the application to the spreading of laccolith is unclear. In particular, the model shows no convergence when hf tends to zero (Lister et al., 2013)

2.3. Application to the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions
33
and therefore, the thickness hf might be linked to some structural length scale
at the front of the laccolith or to the natural imperfection of the flow geometry. For the purpose of the application, we choose a film thickness of 1 mm,
i.e. the minimum length scale with physical significance for the spreading of
laccoliths which give a dimensionless hf that varies between 10-2 and 10-4 .
In the following, we set hf to 10-3 unless otherwise specified.
Dimensionless data and comparison with the model
Each magmatic intrusion unit is made dimensionless using its characteristic
length scale , which depends upon the intrusion depth, and its characteristic
height scale, which is taken as either H = 6 m for felsic laccoliths or H = 0.6
m for large mafic sills (Figure 2.5). When the intrusion depth is not provided,
we use dc = 1.5 km. First, the dimensionless radius of laccoliths at Elba Island
and 95% of those from Corry (1988) are smaller than 4 consistent with their
arrest in the bending regime. The prediction of the model for the evolution
of the thickness h0 of the current as a function of its radius R can be easily
derived from the scaling laws (2.22) and (2.21) and should follow

(2.23)

in agreement with the power law relationship h0 = bRa initially proposed by
McCaffrey and Petford (1997) (Section 1.3.2). To characterize the mean trend
in each population, we use a linear least-square regression in log-log space to
obtain a value for the coefficient a and b that best fit the observations. We
found h0 = 86R1.22 for the laccoliths at Elba island which is very close to
R1.14 predicted by the model (Figure 2.5, r2 = 0.96). Actually, the geometry
of these laccoliths is not well known and probably not perfectly axisymmetric.
-1/7
Hewitt et al. (2014) found that for a two dimensional flow, h0  hf L10/7
where L is the half-length of the flow (10/7  1.43). The best fit value for
the coefficient a then nicely inserts between the expected values for the two
geometries as noted by Michaut (2011). In contrast, the prediction for the
coefficient b is much smaller than the value derived from the observations.
Even for hf = 10-2 , which would be an upper bound for this parameter, the
model predict b = 0.15, which is three orders of magnitudes smaller than
the observations (Figure 2.5). Matching the data to the model will require
using a viscosity h for the magma abnormally high, i.e. h  1015 Pa s or
unreasonable injection rate, i.e. Q0  1 km3 s-1 .
The best fit power law relationship for the laccoliths from Corry (1988) is
h0 = 85R0.62 (Figure 2.5, r2 = 0.54). In that case, the exponent a is smaller
than one and does not agree with the model. This value for a, slightly smaller
than the value calculated directly on the data by McCaffrey and Petford

34

Chapter 2. Isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current model for
shallow magmatic intrusion

(1997), was interpreted as reflecting the two-stage growth process historically
invoked for the formation of laccoliths (Section 1.3.2). However, the dispersion
in the data is much more important than in the observation from Rocchi
et al. (2010) and is not taken into account in the nondimensionalization which
assumes the same parameters for all the different laccoliths. It might explain
the discrepancy between the model prediction and the observation in this
example.
Half of the large mafic sills show dimensionless radius smaller than R = 4,
not consistent with their arrest in the gravity current regime (Figure 2.5). It
might suggest that these mafic sills have intruded shallower into the crust;
for instance, for dc = 250 m, the characteristic length scale for the mafic sill
is smaller  = 800 m and 95% of the population show dimensionless radius
larger than 4. Nevertheless, their dimensionless thickness, which should tend
to a constant of order O(1) according to the model, is much larger than the
expected value and increases with the radius R. For a gravity current in a
two dimensional geometry, the thickness is indeed expected to increase with
the length of the sill, but as L1/4 (Michaut, 2011), i.e. with an exponent much
smaller than the value of 0.76 found for the coefficient a for large mafic sills
(Figure 2.5, r2 = 0.9). Therefore, the model predictions hardly reconcile with
the observations for large mafic sills.

2.3.2

Low-slope domes on the Moon

Observations
On the Moon, 13 elongated low-slope domes, located around the lunar maria,
have been recently identified as potentially intrusive domes (Wohler et al.,
2007, 2009). Wohler et al. (2009) used an image-based 3D reconstruction
approach which relies on a combination of photoclinometry and shape from
shading techniques to determine the morphometric properties of each of these
lunar domes which results in a 10% error estimate on the intrusion thickness.
These data have since been updated by Melanie Thiriet, an under graduate
student in our laboratory, who used the high resolution of the topography
obtained from the 64 ppd,  450 m/pixel (Zuber et al., 2009), LOLA gridded
topography data to reevaluate the thickness and the radius of some of these
potentially intrusive lunar domes (Figure 2.5).
Range of values for the parameters
Given the basalt composition of most lunar rocks brought back from the lunar
maria by the Apollo missions, the lunar magmas are more likely to be mafic
in composition and we use m = 2900 kg m-3 for the lava density. Intrusion

2.3. Application to the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions
35
depths, which are not given by Wohler et al. (2009), should vary between 500
m and 5 km and in the following, we set dc = 1.5 km for all the lunar domes.
Therefore, on the Moon, the larger lava density and the smaller gravity leads to
length scale 1.5 times larger than terrestrial ones. For instance, using E = 10
GPa and dc = 1.5 km, the characteristic length scale for a lunar intrusion is
 5 km and 3.3 km for a terrestrial laccolith.
The source of magma in the lunar interior is poorly constrained and more
likely to be deeper than on Earth; most of the mare basalt are thought to
be a product of melting initiated deep in the lunar mantle, deeper than 400
km (Shearer , 2006). Using the same value for the initial driving pressure,
P = 50 MPa, unless lunar magmas are likely to be more mafic and contain
less volatiles implying smaller driving pressure, and a depth of 500 km for
the magma source region, the overpressure gradient is only of 100 Pa m-1 .
However, reported run out distance for some lava flows in the lunar maria are
very large and implies higher effusion rate than on Earth, i.e. Q0 = 103 - 108
m3 s-1 (Crisp and Baloga, 1990; Zimbelman, 1998). Mare basalts, which
have lower concentration in alkalies than terrestrial basalts, should also have
a lower viscosity (Zimbelman, 1998). We take h = 1 Pa s and for injection
rate between Q0 = 1 - 104 m3 s-1 , the typical height scale for lunar domes
varies between 0.5 and 1.5 m.

Predictions versus observations

After nondimensionalization, the lunar low-slope domes show dimensionless
radius smaller than 4 consistent with their arrest in the bending regime (Figure
2.5). In addition, if we use Q0 = 10 m3 s-1 and the values of the parameters
listed above to calculate the height scale H, they are almost perfectly aligned
with the terrestrial laccolith from Elba Island (Figure 2.5) (Michaut, 2011).
Indeed, the best fit for the power law h0 = bR8/7 for all the observations,
lunar domes + Elba Island laccoliths, is h0 = 103R1.14 with a high correlation
coefficient r2 = 0.9. Given that the same intrusion depth has been arbitrarily chosen for all intrusions, the fit is surprisingly accurate. Therefore, the
isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current model supports the intrusive origin
of the lunar domes described by Wohler et al. (2009) and their arrest in the
bending regime. In addition, it is able to explain the difference between Earth
laccolith and lunar intrusive domes (Michaut, 2011).

2.3.3

What causes the arrest of a shallow magmatic intrusion?

The model shows promising results in reproducing the overall morphology of
terrestrial laccoliths but lacks of a predictive criteria for their arrest. Fracturation is generally considered as the limiting mechanism for the spreading
of magmatic intrusions and in the following, we consider fracturation as a
possible mechanism for the arrest of magmatic intrusions into the bending
regime.
As the flow length increases, the pressure in the intrusion eventually decreases to the critical value equal to the pressure necessary for fracturing the
tip. In that case, fracturing at the tip might limit spreading and trigger the
arrest of a laccolith in the bending regime. The stress intensity factor KI for
a mode I fracture and a uniformly loaded crack situated close to a boundary (i.e., d << R) can be approximated by (Dyskin et al., 2000; Bunger and
Emmanuel , 2005)
KI = KM M0 dc-3/2
(2.24)
where KM = 1.932 is a constant and M0 is the bending moment at the crack
tip given by

Once KI reaches the fracture toughness limit Kc , which is in the range  1-10
MPa m1/2 for crustal rocks and a mode I fracture (Lister and Kerr , 1991),
fracturing at the tip will limit the lateral extent of the intrusion.
Injecting the dimensional scaling law for the thickness h0 as a function of
the radius R (2.23) into the predicted flow shape in the bending regime (2.19)
gives the flow shape as a function of the radius R(t) for a fractured-limited

and therefore mainly depends in the fracture toughness of the encasing rocks.
On can calculate that for typical crustal and magma parameters for terrestrial
laccoliths (Section 2.3) and the largest reported value for the parameter Kc =
10 MPa m1/2 , the dimensionless critical radius is equal to  60 and therefore,
still much larger than the dimensionless transition radius between the bending
and gravity regime R = 4. Therefore, while fracturation might explain the
arrest for large mafic sills, it does not provide a sufficient mechanism for the
arrest of laccoliths.

2.3.4

Discussion

Historical models for intermediate scale magmatic intrusions consider that
the main phase of laccolith growth and spreading require a two-stage process:
horizontal spreading of a sill followed by vertical inflation when the sill has
grown horizontally enough so that the magma has enough leverage on the
overlying layer to begin to bend them upward (Johnson and Pollard , 1973;
Koch et al., 1981). More recent models instead proposed that these intrusions
form as a series of sub-horizontally staked magma sheets (Morgan et al., 2008;
Menand , 2011). While both models are able to account for several geological
observations, they both lack a physical description of the intrusion process
and are then not able to explain the solidified morphology of these magmatic
intrusions in terms of flow parameters (injection rate, volume) at the time of
emplacement.
Michaut (2011) has developed a new approach to model intermediate-scale
intrusions such as sills, laccoliths or bysmaliths through a dynamic elasticplated gravity current model that considers both the bending and the own
weight of the magma as driving the flow. This model shows promising results
in predicting the variety of shapes of intermediate scale magmatic intrusions;
from the dome shape of laccolith to the disk-like morphology of large mafic
sill. It allows to relate the laccolith morphology to the crustal and magma
physical properties, and more importantly, to the injection rate. The prediction of the model, especially the exponent of the thickness to radius power law
relationship, also fits the variability in the laccolith units at Elba Island, hence
providing for a physical explanation for the observed laccolith morphology. In
addition, the model is also consistent with a two-stage growth process; first,
the lateral growth of a sill and then, when the conditions of applicability for
the model are met, i.e. R > h0 and R & dc , spreading and thickening occur
simultaneously (Michaut, 2011). Finally, the model shows promising results
in explaining the discrepancy between terrestrial laccolith and low-slope lunar
domes on the Moon. Therefore, it can be used to assess the intrusive origin
of intrusive candidates on other terrestrial planets.

38

Chapter 2. Isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current model for
shallow magmatic intrusion

However, other questions remain open. First, we have shown that the
model hardly accounts for the absolute final value for both the thickness and
the radius of these laccoliths and that reconciliating predictions and observations requires abnormally high magma viscosity. In addition, we show that the
model does not offer a satisfactory explanation for the increase in large mafic
sill thickness with their diameter. Finally, we also show that fracturation is
not likely to stop a magmatic intrusion in the bending regime. Therefore,
other mechanisms not taken into account in the model of Michaut (2011), are
required to understand the final morphology of these magmatic intrusions.

2.4

Toward a more realistic model for shallow
magmatic intrusions

In this manuscript, we propose to explore two important mechanisms that
have been neglected until now and will certainly influence the emplacement
of shallow magmatic intrusions in the crust of terrestrial planets: the effect a
temperature-dependent rheology for the magma and the effect of an overburden characterized by a non-constant thickness.
The former has already shown important implications for the cooling of
lava domes (Bercovici , 1994; Bercovici and Lin, 1996; Balmforth and Craster ,
2004; Garel et al., 2014). Indeed, the viscosity of magma can vary by several
orders of magnitudes during cooling (Shaw , 1972; Lejeune and Richet, 1995).
As the fluid cools, its composition and crystal content change which, in turn,
modifies the viscosity and the dynamics of the flow itself. The first part of the
manuscript deals with this matter and try to better understand the dynamics
of a cooling elastic-plated gravity current. In particular, in chapter 3, we
propose a model for the cooling of an elastic-plated gravity current with a
temperature-dependent viscosity and isothermal boundary conditions. This
model is next further refined to account for the heating of the wall rocks and
compared to the observation in chapter 4.
The second part of the manuscript addresses the second point and in particular, the problem of crater-centered intrusions with application to the endogenous deformations observed at lunar floor-fractured craters. Indeed, these
impact craters on the Moon show important deformations that might be related to the emplacement of a shallow magmatic intrusion below their floor
(Schultz , 1976a). Chapter 5 presents the theoretical model and its application
to the deformations observed at floor-fractured craters. Then, chapter 6 takes
the study of floor-fractured craters one step further by looking at the gravitational signature of lunar floor-fractured craters in the light of the model
predictions.

This thesis, closely combining theoretical models and observations, expands and generalizes the model of Michaut (2011) exposed in this chapter,
and sheds light on the final morphology of shallow magmatic intrusions on
one side and on the origin of lunar floor-fractured craters on the other side.

Temperature-dependent elastic-plated gravity currents have numerous applications in nature, from shallow magmatic intrusions to the flow of meltwater below an ice sheet. We develop the general equations for an elasticplated gravity current with a temperature-dependent viscosity for constant
influx conditions. We show that the coupling between the thermal structure
and the flow itself results in important deviations from the isoviscous case. In
particular, the bending and gravity asymptotic regimes, characteristic of the
isoviscous case, both split into three phases: a first 'hot' isoviscous phase, a
second phase where the flow effective viscosity and thickness drastically increase and a third 'cold' isoviscous phase. These three phases are controlled
by the extent of the thermal anomaly, for which we develop analytical scaling
laws. The effective flow viscosity is governed by the local thermal state at the
current tip in the bending regime while it is the average flow viscosity in the
gravity regime. In the end, the complete evolution of such an elastic-plated
gravity current depends on its thermal state at the transition between the
bending and gravity regimes. We provide a phase diagram which predicts
the different evolution scenarios as a function of the flow Peclet number and
viscosity contrast.

3.1

Introduction

Elastic-plated gravity currents involve the spreading of viscous material beneath an elastic sheet. The applications range from the emplacement of lava in
the shallow crust (Michaut, 2011; Bunger and Cruden, 2011) and melt-water
drainage below ice sheet (Das et al., 2008; Tsai and Rice, 2010) in geological
setting to the manufacture of flexible electronics and microelectromechanical
systems (MEMS) in engineering (Hosoi and Mahadevan, 2004).
When the thickness of the flow is small compared to its extent, lubrication approximation applies and the study of elastic-plated gravity currents
resumes to the study of a sixth order, non-linear partial differential equation
(Michaut, 2011; Lister et al., 2013; Hewitt et al., 2014) . However, the assumption that the thickness of the fluid tends to zero at the contact line leads
to divergent viscous stresses, and hence, a regularization condition is needed
at the front (Flitton and King, 2004; Lister et al., 2013; Hewitt et al., 2014).

3.2. Theory

45

One common approach is to add a thin prewetting film of fluid, thus avoiding
the requirement for any boundary conditions at the contact line (Lister et al.,
2013; Hewitt et al., 2014).
The dynamics of the spreading has been described in an axisymmetric
geometry for a Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity (Michaut, 2011; Lister
et al., 2013; Thorey and Michaut, 2014) and show two distinct regimes of
evolution. First, gravity is negligible and the peeling of the front is driven by
bending of the overlying layer; the interior is bell-shaped, the radius evolves
as t8/22 and the thickness as t7/22 . When the radius becomes larger than 4,
where  is the flexural wavelength of the upper layer, the weight of the current
becomes dominant over the bending terms and the flow enters a gravity current
regime (Huppert, 1982a). In this regime, the thickness profile develops a flat
top with bent edges, the radius evolves as t1/2 while the thickness tends to
a constant. Different analogue experiments of isoviscous flows confirm these
theoretical results (Dixon and Simpson, 1987; Lister et al., 2013).
However, in many real geological settings, the isothermal/isoviscous assumption are not valid. For instance, the viscosity of magmas, produced by
partial melting of the upper mantle, can vary by several orders of magnitude
(Shaw , 1972; Lejeune and Richet, 1995). Therefore, as the fluid flows, it cools
down, its composition and crystal content change which, in turn, modifies the
viscosity and the dynamics of the flow. Several studies have shown that, in a
gravity current, this coupling between the cooling and the flow itself results
in important deviations from the isoviscous case (Bercovici , 1994; Bercovici
and Lin, 1996; Balmforth and Craster , 2004; Garel et al., 2014).
In this paper, we examine how the spreading of an elastic-plated gravity
current is affected by the cooling itself. In particular, we consider the problem
of an elastic-plated gravity current whose viscosity depends on temperature
according to a prescribed rheology (T ). This gives rise to a set of two coupled
non-linear equations that we solve numerically. We study the flow thermal
structure and its effect on the dynamics through the rheology in each regime
separately. In both regimes, we identify different "thermal" phases of propagation that we characterize by different scaling laws.x

Theory
Formulation

We model the axisymmetric flow of fluid below an elastic layer of constant
thickness dc and above a semi infinite rigid layer (Figure 3.1). The assumption
that the thickness of the fluid h(r, t) tends to zero at the contact line leads

to divergent viscous stresses and to the theoretical immobility of the current
(Flitton and King, 2004). To avoid problem at the contact line, we consider
a thin pre-wetting film of thickness hf (Lister et al., 2013) (Figure 3.1).
The fluid is injected continuously at the base and center of the current at
a constant rate Q0 through a conduit of diameter a. The hot fluid is intruded
at temperature Ti and cools through the top and bottom by conduction in the
surrounding medium, whose temperature is considered constant and equal to
T0 . In using a fixed temperature at the flow boundary, we essentially assume
that the fluid is bounded by a medium with infinite thermal conductivity.
As it cools, the viscosity of the fluid increases following a prescribed
temperature-dependent rheology (T ) given by
(T ) =

h c (Ti - T0 )
h (Ti - T0 ) + (c - h )(T - T0 )

(3.1)

where h and c are the viscosities of the hottest and coldest fluid at the
temperature Ti and T0 respectively (Bercovici , 1994). Although this rheology
is largely simplified, the inverse dependence of viscosity on temperature captures the essential behavior of a viscous fluid, i.e. the viscosity variations are
the largest where the temperature is the coldest (Shaw , 1972; Marsh, 1981;
Lejeune and Richet, 1995; Giordano et al., 2008).

deflection h(r, t) of the upper elastic layer is small compared to its thickness
dc , i.e h << dc , we can neglect stretching of the upper layer and only consider
bending stresses. Therefore, the total pressure P (r, z, t) at a level z in the
current is the sum of three contributions: the weight of the magma and of the
upper layer and the bending pressure
P = m g(h - z) + r gdc + D4r h

where T (r, z, t) is the fluid temperature and m , km and Cp,m are the density,
thermal conductivity and specific heat of the fluid. Here, we also account for
energy release by crystallization of the fluid, which is a non negligible source
of heat for magmas; (r, z, t) is the crystal fraction in the melt and L the
latent heat of crystallization. In this model, the crystals are considered only
as a source/sink of energy as they melt/form during flow emplacement. In
particular, the physical properties of the fluid are not modified by the presence
of crystals.
Following a common approximation, we assume that the crystal fraction
is a linear function of temperature over the melting interval

where TS and TL are the solidus and liquidus temperatures of the magma

fluid is injected at its liquidus temperature , i.e. TL = Ti and, for simplicity,
that the solidus temperature is equal to the surrounding rock temperature
TS = T0 . With these approximations, the local energy equation (3.7) resumes

transport equation (3.9). This theory is based on the integral-balance method
of heat-transfer theory of Goodman (1958), in which the vertical structure
of the temperature field is represented by a known function of depth that
approximates the expected solution.
3.2.4.2

Integral balance solution for the temperature T (r, z, t)

Following Balmforth and Craster (2004), we model the cooling of the flow
through the growth of two thermal boundary layers: one growing downward
from the top and a second growing upward from the base. As we consider
homogeneous thermal properties for the surrounding rocks, we assume that
the two thermal boundary layers grow symmetrically and have the same thickness (r, t) (Figure 3.1). We use the following approximation for the vertical
temperature profile T (r, z, t)

where Tb (r, t) is the temperature at the center of the flow. The integral balance
solution in (3.10) assumes a symmetry around z = h/2 and a decrease of the
temperature in the two thermal boundary layers down to the surrounding
rock temperature T0 (Balmforth and Craster , 2004). In addition, it assumes a
uniform temperature Tb in between the thermal boundary layers. As the fluid
is injected at temperature Ti , we have Tb (r, t) = Ti as long as  < h/2 (Figure
3.1). However, if the two thermal boundary layers connect, then  = h/2 and
Tb  Ti . This profile assures the continuity of the temperature and heat flux
within the flow.
3.2.4.3

Integral balance equation

We begin by integrating the local energy conservation equation (3.9) separately over the two thermal boundary layers. The integration over the bottom
thermal layer, i.e. from the base, z = 0 to a level z =  gives

To obtain an equation for the flow thickness, we first note that the chosen
vertical structure of the temperature field (3.10) is symmetric around h/2,
and thus, because the boundary condition are the same at z = 0 and z = h,
the viscosity and velocity u possess the same symmetry.
Taking advantage of

Indeed, if the thermal boundary layers exist, b = 1,  is the variable quantity

Preliminary results for an isothermal flow

For a constant injection rate, a small pre-wetting film thickness, i.e. hf << 1
and a viscosity contrast  set to 1, numerical resolution of (3.46) shows two
asymptotic spreading regimes (Michaut, 2011; Lister et al., 2013).
At early times, when R << , gravity is negligible and the spreading
dynamics is governed by the bending of the upper layer. The spreading is
very slow and the interior has uniform pressure P = 4r h. The flow is bellshaped and its thickness is given by

h(r, t) = h0 (t) 1 - 2
(3.50)
R (t)
with h0 (t) the thickness of the current at the center (Michaut, 2011; Lister
et al., 2013). In this regime, Lister et al. (2013) have shown that the spreading
is controlled by the propagation of a peeling by bending wave at the flow front

where the numerical pre-factor obtained in our simulations match those of
Lister et al. (2013) (Figure 3.2).
In contrast, when the radius R becomes larger than 4 (R >> ), the
weight of the current becomes dominant over the bending terms. The pressure
is given by the hydrostatic pressure P = h and the current enters a classical
gravity current regime where bending terms only affect the solution near the
edge of the current (Huppert, 1982a; Michaut, 2011; Lister et al., 2013). In
this second regime, the radius evolves as t1/2 and the thickness tends to a
constant (Figure 3.2).
In the following, we study the effect of the cooling on the flow dynamics
in both regimes separately. We first describe the thermal structure for an
isoviscous flow, i.e.  = 1 and then study the effect of the temperaturedependent viscosity on the flow dynamics without crystallization, i.e Stm = 1.
Finally, we introduce crystallization by setting Stm < 1. For simplicity, we

56

present the results for a given film thickness (hf = 5*10-3 ); results for different
film thicknesses are shown in Appendix C.

3.3

Evolution in the bending regime

We first concentrate on the case in which only bending contributes to the
dynamic pressure. The governing equations are thus (3.46) and (3.47) where
P = 4r h.

3.3.1

Thermal structure for an isoviscous flow, effect of
Pe

The current cools by conduction and thermal boundary layers form at the
contact with the surrounding medium. These boundary layers first connect
at the tip of the flow, where the small thickness induces an important cooling
(Figure 3.3). A region of cold fluid forms at the front.
As the current thickens with time, a balance between advection and diffusion of heat is never reached in the interior of the current. The hot thermal
anomaly grows in extent with time but slower than the current itself and the
cold fluid region at the tip grows. For instance, for P e = 100, while the region
of cold fluid extends over about 10% of the current at t = 0.5, it extends
over about 20% at t = 10 (Figure 3.3). The smaller P e, the more important
the conductive cooling and the larger the cold region (Figure 3.4 and 3.5).
For instance, at t = 10, while the cold region extends over about 20% of the
current for P e = 100, it extends over more than 70% for P e = 1 (Figure 3.4).

3.3.2

Thickness and temperature profile, effect of 

When accounting for the temperature dependence of the viscosity, the region
of cold fluid at the tip is marked by a higher viscosity and enhances flow
thickening at the expense of spreading. The larger the viscosity contrast, the
larger the aspect ratio h0 /R (Figure 3.4). For instance, for the same value
of P e = 1, while the aspect ratio is 0.7 for  = 1 at t = 10, it is 4.2 at
the same time for  = 10-3 (Figure 3.4). Nevertheless, the shape of the flow
remains essentially self-similar, i.e. well described by (3.50) and cannot be
differentiated from the shape of an isoviscous current if the thickness and the
radial coordinates are rescaled by the thickness at the center h0 (t) and radius
R(t) (Figure 3.5).
The flow thermal structure is similar to the isoviscous case (Figure 3.4),
the thermal anomaly rapidly detaches from the tip of the current and a region

of cold fluid develops at the front where heat loss is the largest. However,
the important thickening induced by the viscosity increase limits heat loss to
the surrounding. The larger the viscosity contrast , the more important the
thickening and the larger the thermal anomaly at a given time. For instance,
for P e = 1, while the thermal anomaly extends over about 30% of the flow
for  = 1 at t = 10, it extends over more than 50% for  = 10-3 (Figure 3.4).
As expected, a larger Peclet number leads to a larger thermal anomaly
(Figure 3.4). However, although different Peclet numbers cause very different
thermal structures, the influence of the Peclet number on the flow morphology
is small, much smaller than the effect of the viscosity contrast  (Figure 3.4).
For instance, for  = 10-3 at t = 10, the thermal anomaly is still attached
to the tip of the current for P e = 1000 whereas it makes about 50% of the
current for P e = 1; but, the thickness h0 and the radius R in both cases differ
only by a few percents (Figure 3.4). This suggests that, in this regime, the
spreading of the flow is not controlled by the mean temperature or average
viscosity of the flow.

3.3.3

Evolution of the thickness and the radius

In this bending dominated regime, the dynamics show three different spreading phases. The thickness as well as the radius first follow the isoviscous
scaling laws for a hot viscosity current h0  t8/22 (3.52) and R  t7/22 (3.53)
(Figure 3.6). In the second phase, thickening occurs at the expense of spread-

ing because the thermal anomaly has detached from the current radius and
the viscous cold fluid region at the front slows down the spreading. Finally,
the dynamics enters a third phase where the thickness and radius follow the
scaling laws for the spreading of an isoviscous current characterized by a dimensionless cold viscosity 1/. These scaling laws are obtained from (3.52)
and (3.53) by rescaling the characteristic thickness and time by  1/4 and read

The dependence on the viscosity contrast  indeed fits very well the third
phase of the flow observed in the numerical simulations (Figure 3.6). In the
end, the effective viscosity e of the flow evolves from the viscosity of the hot
fluid in the first phase to asymptotically tend to the one of the cold fluid in
the third phase.
The time the flow spends in each phase depends on the Peclet number P e.
For instance, for  = 10-3 , while the current leaves the first phase at t  10-6
for P e = 1.0, this transition happens only after t  10-2 for P e = 103 (Figure
3.6). The larger the Peclet number, the less efficient the cooling and thus the
longer the flow remains in the first phase and the later it reaches the third
phase.

Characterization of the thermal anomaly

Following Garel et al. (2012), we quantify the size of the thermal anomaly
through a critical thermal radius Rc (t) where the temperature at the center
of the flow b is 1% of the injection temperature, i.e. b (r = 0) - b (r =
Rc ) = 0.99. The thermal anomaly is first advected at the same velocity as the
current itself, i.e. R(t) = Rc (t) (Figure 3.7 left). After a time that depends
on P e and , the thermal anomaly detaches from the tip and R(t) - Rc (t)
increases with time (Figure 3.7) .
In the bending regime, the interior pressure is constant and the thickness
profile h(r) is given by (3.50) (Figure 3.5). The time evolution of the size of
the thermal anomaly Rc (t) is characterized by looking at the radius in the
flow where heat advection locally balances heat loss, i.e.

numbers (Figure 3.7). For  = 1 and P e = 1, the condition R - Rc << R is
no more respected for t > 0.1, the thermal anomaly is much smaller than the
flow itself and the evolution of the cold fluid region diverges from (3.59).

3.3.5

Effective viscosity of the current

We use the predicted scaling law for the thickness h0 (t) (3.54) to infer the
time evolution of the effective viscosity e (t). Substituting  by h /e (t) in
(3.54) and inverting for e (t)/h , we get

h0 (t)t-8/22
(3.60)
e (t)/h =
-1/11
0.7hf
where h0 (t) is given by the simulation.
As suggested by the results of section 3.3.3, the effective viscosity is first
close to the hot viscosity h , i.e. e /h  1 (Figure 3.8 a). It rapidly increases
in the second phase of propagation and finally tends to the cold viscosity c
in the third phase, i.e. e /h  1/. The effective viscosity is however very
different from the average viscosity (Figure 3.8 a). Since the spreading is
controlled by the propagation of a peeling by bending wave at the tip of the
current (Lister et al., 2013), the evolution of the effective viscosity should be
linked to the rapid cooling of the front. We calculate the average viscosity
f (t) over a fixed front region of size L in between R(t) - L and R(t)

viscosity e for the second phase of propagation (Figure 3.8 a). Therefore, the
effective viscosity, and thus the different phases of propagation, are controlled
by the average viscosity of a small region at the front of size L = O(0.1).
At the initiation of the flow, the prewetting film is composed by fluid at
the injection temperature, the thermal anomaly is attached to the front and
the current spreads with a hot viscosity h . Once the film has cooled by
conduction, which occurs over a time tb2 = 0.1P eh2f , where the numerical
prefactor has been matched to the simulations, the thermal anomaly detaches
from the current tip and the effective viscosity starts to increase. Indeed,
when rescaling the time of the simulations by tb2 , the different simulations
enter the second phase simultaneously (Figure 3.8 b). Then, the size of the
cold fluid region at the front increases, the effective viscosity increases and the
flow finally behaves as an isoviscous current when its effective viscosity becomes close to its maximum value 1/. In the following, we use e = 0.9c to
determine the time tb3 the current enters this third phase which happens when
-7/27
R(t) - Rc (t) . 0.5. Inverting (3.59) thus gives tb3  0.03P e22/27  -14/27 hf
.
Indeed, when rescaling the time of the simulations by tb3 , the different simulations enter the third phase simultaneously (Figure 3.8 c).

3.3.6

Note on the effect of crystallization

Here, we examine the effect of crystallization on the flow dynamics and use
a value of Stm = 0.17 < 1, relevant for magmas. Crystallization induces a
release of latent heat in the fluid, increasing the amount of available energy at
a given time. When Stm < 1, the tip of the current remains hot for a longer
time and the flow transitions to the second phase later than in the case where
Stm = 1 (Figure 3.9). As the crystallization acts only to reduce the cooling
term by a factor Stm in (3.47), one can easily rewrite (3.59) to acount for the
effect of crystallization on the size of the cold fluid region

Indeed, the dependence with the dimensionless number Stm is well described

accounting for crystallization and respectively read

Chapter 3. Elastic-plated gravity current with
temperature-dependent viscosity

Evolution in the gravity current regime

To study the late time behavior, we concentrate on the case where only the
weight of the fluid contributes to the pressure. The governing equations are
thus (3.46) and (3.47) where P = h. We follow the same framework as in
Section 3.3.

3.4.1

Thermal structure for an isoviscous flow, effect of
Pe

As in the bending regime, the bulk of the fluid first expands at the injection
temperature and Rc (t)  R(t). As the bottom and the top cool by conduction,
thermal boundary layers form at the contact with the surrounding medium
and connect at the tip of the current. However, in the gravity current regime,
the thickness of the current tends to a constant. Therefore, conduction in
the surrounding medium rapidly balances the input of heat at the center and
when the thermal anomaly detaches from the tip of the current, its extent
reaches a steady state (Figure 3.11).
The radius of the steady-state thermal anomaly Rc also largely depends on
P e in this regime: the larger the number P e, the larger the radius Rc (Figure
3.12). For instance, while the thermal anomaly Rc is less than 1 in the steady
state regime for P e = 1, it is about 12 for P e = 103 (Figure 3.12,  = 1).

3.4.2

Thickness and temperature profile, effect of 

For a current with a viscosity that depends on temperature, as soon as the
thermal anomaly detaches from the current radius, the cold fluid at the front
tends to slow down the spreading and enhance the thickening of the flow
(Figure 3.12). For instance, for P e = 1, while the aspect ratio h0 /R is about
0.12 for  = 1 at t = 200, it is  1 for  = 10-3 (Figure 3.12). The shape of the
current is not self-similar and the front steepens when the viscosity increases
in comparison to the isoviscous case as noted by Bercovici (1994). However,
when the current becomes much larger than the thermal anomaly, the current
side slumps to become less steep (Figure 3.12) and recovers a shape similar
to the isoviscous flow with cold viscosity.
The thermal structure is similar to the isoviscous case. In particular,
after a time that depends on P e, the thermal anomaly reaches a steady-state
profile (Figure 3.12). As in the bending regime, the thickening at the center
limits heat loss to the surrounding for large values of the viscosity contrast .
Therefore, the extent of the thermal anomaly in the steady-state is slightly
larger for a larger viscosity contrast. For instance, for P e = 10 at t = 200,

while the thermal anomaly extends over less than 2 for  = 1, it reaches

The flow morphology is much more sensitive to P e in the gravity current
regime than in the bending regime and different P e lead to different current
morphologies for a given  (Figure 3.12). For instance, for  = 10-3 at t = 200,
the thermal anomaly is still attached to the tip for P e = 103 and the aspect
ratio of the flow h0 /R is close to 0.15. In contrast, for P e = 1, the thermal
anomaly radius Rc is less than 30% of the current radius and the aspect ratio
of the flow is much larger h0 /R = 1.15 (Figure 3.12).

3.4.3

Evolution of the thickness and radius

As in the bending regime, the dynamics in the gravity current regime shows
three different spreading phases. The thickness as well as the radius first
follow the isoviscous scaling laws for a given hot viscosity h , i.e. h0 tends
to a constant and R  t1/2 (Figure 3.13). In a second phase, the thickness
rapidly increases and the spreading slows down. Finally, the thickness and
radius follow the isoviscous scaling laws but for a cold viscosity flow.
These dimensionless scaling laws read, as a function of

They perfectly match our numerical simulations (Figure 3.13). Therefore,
the effective viscosity e that controls the flow dynamics is first close to the
viscosity of the hot fluid h ; it then rapidly increases to asymptotically tend
to the viscosity of the cold fluid c in the third phase.
As in the bending regime, the time the current spends in each phase depends on P e (Figure 3.13). For instance, for  = 10-2 , while the current
leaves the first phase at t  10-1 for P e = 1.0, the transition occurs after
t  101 for P e = 102 (Figure 3.13). The larger the P e, the longer the current
remains in the first phase and the later is reached the third phase.

3.4.4

Characterization of the thermal anomaly

The thermal anomaly is first advected at the same velocity as the current
itself, i.e. Rc (t)/R(t)  1 (Figure 3.14 left). After a time that depends on P e
and , the thermal anomaly detaches from the front and reaches a steady-state
profile (Figure 3.12 and 3.14).
We develop a simple thermal budget to predict the extent of the thermal anomaly in the steady-state regime. At the steady state radius Rc of

where T is a mean temperature contrast between the fluid and the surroundings and U0 is a mean velocity of advection. For a gravity current, and by
opposition to the bending regime, the thickness h0 reaches a constant. Taking
U0 as a horizontal redistribution of the injection rate at r = Rc , we write
U0 = Q0 /(2Rc h0 )

The scaling law (3.70) closely fits the numerical simulations (Figure 3.14).
Indeed, when the thermal anomaly enters the steady state, the thermal
anomaly radius remains constant and the normalized thermal anomaly radius
Rc (t)/R(t) evolves as the inverse of the current radius, i.e. as t-1/2 (Figure
3.14). Furthermore, both the dependence with P e and  vanish when rescaling
Rc /R(t) by P e1/2  -1/4 in the steady state regime (Figure 3.14, right).

3.4.5

Effective viscosity of the current

Repeating the same exercise as in section (3.3.5), we use the predicted scaling
law for the radius R(t) (3.66) to infer the effective viscosity e (t) of the current

e (t)/h =

R(t)t-1/2

(3.71)

where R(t) is given by the simulation.
As expected, the effective viscosity in the gravity current regime represents
the average viscosity of the current and the different phases of propagation
reflect changes in the average viscosity of the flow (Figure 3.15 a).

At the flow initiation, the thermal anomaly is advected at the same velocity
as the current itself and the current spreads with hot viscosity h . When the
thermal anomaly detaches from the tip and enters a steady state, e increases.
The time tg2 to enter this second phase scales with the time to cool the current
by conduction, i.e. tg2 = 10-2 P e where the numerical pre-factor has been
matched to the simulations. Indeed, when rescaling the time by tg2 , the
different simulations enter the second phase simultaneously (Figure 3.15 b).
Then, the size of the cold fluid region at the front increases, the effective
viscosity increases and the flow finally behaves as an isoviscous current when
its effective viscosity becomes close to its maximum value 1/. As in the
bending regime, we use e = 0.9c to define the time tg3 the current enters the
third phase of the dynamics which happens when Rc (t)/R(t) . 0.3. Inverting
(3.70) thus gives tg3 = 5.2P e -1/2 . Indeed, when rescaling the time of the
simulations by tg3 , the different combinations (, P e) enter the third phase
simultaneously (Figure 3.15 c).

3.4.6

Note on the effect of crystallization

As in the bending regime, crystallization induces a release of latent heat,
increasing the amount of available energy at a given time. As a result, when
Stm < 1, the current is hotter on average and it transitions to the second
phase later than in the case where Stm = 1 (Figure 3.16). As in section
(3.3.6), one can easily rewrite (3.70) to account for the effect of crystallization

Different evolutions with bending and gravity

For an isoviscous flow with hf << h << dc , in between the bending and
gravity regime, Lister et al. (2013) also describe a short intermediate regime
where the peeling by bending continues to control the propagation but where
the flow shows an interior flat-topped region due to the increasing effect of
gravity. For simplicity, we only consider the two asymptotic regimes. At the
transition, the isoviscous current is characterized by R  4 and for hf = 0.005,

P em = P eSt-1
m which integrates the effect of crystallization for clarity.
For a current with a temperature-dependent viscosity, the transition between the bending regime and the gravity regime also occurs when the radius
of the current reaches R  4 (Figure 3.18). However, the current thickness
and time at the transition depend on the thermal state of the flow, i.e. on the
combination of (,P em ) considered (Figure 3.18). For instance, for  = 0.01
and a small value of P e, i.e. P e = 1.0, the current transitions to the gravity
regime at t  50 with h0  8 while in the third thermal phase of the bending
regime. It is then characterized by a cold viscosity c = 100 and a large aspect
ratio. In contrast, for a larger value of P e, i.e. P e = 105 , the current remains
longer in the first phase of the bending regime and it spreads with hot viscosity h for a longer period of time. As a consequence, it reaches R  4 and
enters the gravity regime sooner at t  30 while in the second phase of the
bending regime and hence characterized by a smaller thickness h0  5 and
a smaller aspect ratio. For even larger Peclet number P e, the current would
transition while in the first thermal phase of the bending regime at t  10
and with h0  2, as in the isoviscous case with viscosity h .
Overall, the time for the current to reach the transition tt is the time
for its radius to reach R(t) = 4. Setting (3.55) equal to 4, we obtain tt =
-1/7
6.5(e /h )2/7 hf
where e is the effective viscosity of the current (see Section

between bending and gravity which is bound by tht , when the current transitions in the first bending thermal phase, and tct , when the current transitions
in the third bending thermal phase. tb2 (resp. tb3 ) represents the time to
transition from phase 1 to phase 2 (resp. from phase 2 to phase 3) in the
bending regime. tg2 (resp. tg3 ) represents the time to transition from phase 1
to phase 2 (resp. from phase 2 to phase 3) in the gravity regime.

3.3.5). In particular, it is bounded by two values corresponding to two endmember cases: the case where the current transitions to the gravity regime
-1/7
while in the first bending phase, i.e. when e = h and tht  6.5hf
and
the case where the current transitions to the gravity regime while in the third
-1/7
bending phase, i.e. e = c and tct  6.5 -2/7 hf . Indeed, when rescaling
the time of the simulation by tct , the different simulations, for which the third
thermal phase of the bending regime has been reached before the transition
to the gravity regime, collapse on the same curve (Figure 3.19, right).
The subsequent evolution in the gravity regime also depends on the combinations (,P em ) considered. Indeed, in contrast to the bending regime where
the effective viscosity is that of a small region at the tip, the effective viscosity is the average flow viscosity in the gravity regime. Therefore, the effective
viscosity of the flow can drastically decrease when entering the gravity regime
and a flow in the ith thermal phase of the bending regime can transition in the
jth thermal phase of the gravity regime with i  j which results in 6 possible
scenarios. For instance, a current in the second thermal phase of the bending
regime can transition into the first or second thermal phase of the gravity
current regime. However, the case where a current in the third thermal phase
of the bending regime transitions to the first thermal phase of the gravity
regime is not possible since the thermal anomaly has already detached from

build a phase diagram as a function of the combination (, P em ) considered.
We first consider the case where the current transitions to the gravity
regime in the first thermal phase of the bending regime. In that case, the
time for the transition is tht ; it is less than the time for the second bending

, as tht < tg2 , the current transitions to the
first thermal phase of the gravity current regime (B1 G1 in Figure 3.20).

transition occurs at tct and is necessarily larger than tb3 ; comparing tct and

(Figure 3.20, Table 3.1). As tct > tg2 for

 > 8.3 * 10-13 P em hf , the current can either transition to the second or
third thermal phase of the bending regime. If it transitions to the second

phase of the gravity regime, then comparing tct and tg3 gives  < 0.3P em hf
(B3 G2 on Figure 3.20) and if it transitions to the third phase of the gravity

current, then  > 0.3P em hf (B3 G3 on Figure 3.20).
In the case where the transition occurs when it is in the second bending
phase, the time for the transition is not exactly known. However, it is bounded
by tht and tct and we can therefore predict some evolution scenarios. Indeed,
the transition time is necessarily smaller than tct . Therefore, if tct < tg2 , i.e.

Summary and conclusion

Isothermal elastic-plated gravity current shows two asymptotic regimes. At
early times, the gravity is negligible and the peeling of the front is driven
by the bending of the overlying layer. In contrast, at late times, the own
flow weight becomes the driving pressure and the current evolves in a gravity
current regime. In this study, we have developed a theory for the evolution of
an elastic-plated gravity current with a temperature dependent viscosity and
studied the response of the flow to its cooling in each regime separately.
In the bending regime, since the flow constantly thickens, the thermal
anomaly grows with time but slower than the flow itself and a region of cold

fluid rapidly forms at the front. In contrast, in the gravity current regime,
since the flow tends to a constant thickness, the temperature profile diffuses to
an almost stationary profile and the thermal anomaly reaches a steady-state.
The time to reach this steady-state also scales with the dimensionless numbers
of the system. Analyses of the heat transport equation in both regimes allowed
us to predict the time evolution of this thermal anomaly as a function of the
dimensionless number of the system (P e,, Stm ).
Numerical resolution of the equations show that the combine effect of
cooling and temperature-dependent viscosity result in important deviations
from the isoviscous case. In particular, each regime is split in three different
phases: a first phase where the flow behaves as an isoviscous flow with a hot
viscosity, a second phase where the flow slows down and drastically thickens
and a last phase where the flow returns in an isoviscous flow but with a cold
viscosity. These three phases are linked to the coupling between the thermal
anomaly and the flow itself and in particular, the second phase of the flow is
triggered by the detachment of the thermal anomaly. However, we show that
the effective viscosity of the flow is drastically different in the two regimes.
While the dynamics is governed by the local thermal state of the front in the
bending regime, it is the average thermal structure of the current that controls
the flow in the gravity regime.
The final evolution of an elastic-plated gravity current therefore depends
on the relative phase change within each regime and on the transition between
the bending and the gravity regime itself. We provide a general phase diagram
that predicts the different evolution scenarios as a function of the dimensionless parameters. This model for the cooling of an elastic-plated gravity current
is further refined and apply to the observation in the next chapter.

Chapter 4. Toward a more realistic model and its application to
82
the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions

The previous chapter was first step toward the understanding of the coupling between the cooling and the spreading of an elastic-plated gravity current. Hereafter, we first investigate the changes in the dynamics caused by
both the heating of the wall rocks and a more realistic rheology for the magma.
We then compare the model predictions with the observations presented in
Chapter 2.

4.1

Motivation

Numerous geological explorations demonstrate that magmatic intrusions affect the host rock by developing contact-metamorphic aureoles (Jaeger , 1959;
Galushkin, 1997; Senger et al., 2014). For instance, the Leadville Limestone
in Colorado, USA, famous for preserving fossils dating back to the Carboniferous period, was locally transformed into marble following the intrusion of the
Treasure Mountain Dome (Figure 4.1). The increase in the geothermal gradient in sedimentary basins also tends to accelerate the thermal maturation
of organic matter in the surrounding, promoting the hydrocarbon generation
(Senger et al., 2014). Release of CO2 during the metamorphism processes
have also been proposed to help the formation of ore deposits in the vicinity
of magmatic intrusions (Sillitoe and Thompson, 1998; Ganino et al., 2008;
Zhou et al., 2008).
The size of the contact aureole depends on the regional context and
can reach reach more than 100% of the intrusion thickness in many region
(Galushkin, 1997). This contact aureole, by retaining the heat within the
flow, may also affect the dynamics of the magmatic intrusion itself. In the
following, we relax the isothermal boundary condition used in Chapter 3 to
investigate its influence of the dynamics.

We consider the model of elastic-plated gravity current with temperaturedependent viscosity described in Section 3.2 in which we relax the isothermal
boundary condition. In the following, we specify only the changes in the
theory that come with the new thermal boundary condition and we refer the
reader to Section 3.2 for more details about the derivation.

Rheology

The model derived in Section 4.2.2 does not yet assume a specific relation
between viscosity and temperature and the choice of the rheology (T ), which
is contained in the integrals I0 (z), I1 (z) and I2 (z), remains to be defined. In
Section 3.2, we assume a viscosity inversely dependent on the temperature
which reads in a dimensional form
(T ) =

h c (Ti - T0 )
.
h (Ti - T0 ) + (c - h )(T - T0 )

(4.27)

4.2. Theory

87

where h and c are the viscosities of the hottest and coldest fluid at the temperature Ti and T0 respectively (Bercovici , 1994). While this model possesses
some nice simplification properties, it restricts the change in viscosity to a very
narrow range of temperature close to T = T0 , i.e.  = 0 (Figure 4.2). In contrast, the Arrhenius model (  exp(-k/T )), which is a more realistic model
to relate temperature and viscosity of lavas (Blatt et al., 2006), describes a
viscosity that increases over a much larger range of temperature (Figure 4.2).
To get some insights into the effect of a more realistic temperature-dependent
viscosity, we thus also use a first-order approximation of the Arrhenius model
as a second rheology 2 (T ) (Diniega et al., 2013)

Appendix A for both rheologies.

4.2.4

Comparison with the isothermal model

We showed that relaxing the isothermal boundary condition introduces a new
dimensionless number  which controls how much heat can be transferred to
the surrounding rocks. In the limit   , the model should thus reduce to
the model described in Section 3.2. Indeed, when   , the coefficient  
 and then t  h/6 (Section 3.2). When  < t , injecting the corresponding
expression of s (4.22) in the corresponding expression of  (4.24) gives
 p
3 + 3 (3 + 8) + 8
=
(4.31)
2
which tends to 3 when   . When  > t , injecting the corresponding
expression of s (4.22) in the corresponding expression of b (4.23) gives
b =

3(h + 4)(h - 2)
2h(h + 6)

(4.32)

which tends to 3/2 - 3/h when    (Section 3.2). Finally, taking the
limit of s for both  > t and  < t show that s indeed tends to zero when
  .
For magmatic intrusions, the thermal parameters of the magma and the
encasing rocks are close and the dimensionless number  would be close to
1. In the following, we study the effect of relaxing the isothermal boundary
condition on the dynamics by comparing  = 105 and  = 1 in both regimes
separately. We also investigate the effect of a more realistic rheology on the
flow dynamics.

4.3

Evolution in the bending regime

We follow the same approach as in the previous Chapter and first concentrate
on the case in which only bending contributes to the pressure. The governing
equations are thus (4.8) and (4.9) where P = 4r h. For isothermal boundary
condition, we show that the dynamics in the bending regime depends on
the average viscosity of a small region at the front of the current and can
be divided into three phases. Hereafter, we first describe how the thermal
boundary condition influences the timing for the phase transition by looking
at two values for the dimensionless number , i.e.  = 1 and  = 105 and
() = 1 (). We thus investigate the effect of changing the rheology.

m /r is set to 1. The thermal structure below the intrusions is similar and
not shown for clarity.

4.3.1

Relaxing the thermal boundary condition, effect of


The heating of the surrounding medium limits heat loss in the flow central
region and the thermal anomaly extends further into the flow (Figure 4.3).
For instance, for  = 0.001 and P e = 1.0, while the thermal anomaly extends
over 50% of the current for  = 105 at t = 10, it extends over more than 75%
of the flow for  = 1 (Figure 4.3). Nevertheless, the tip of the current is still
rapidly cooling and the thermal anomaly also detaches from the front when
relaxing the thermal boundary condition.
Hence, the dynamics for  = 1 also passes through three different phases.
The current first behaves as an isoviscous flow with hot viscosity, it then slows
down and thickens to finally behave again as an isoviscous flow but with cold
viscosity (Figure 4.4). As the current tip remains hot for a longer period
of time, the transition to the second and third bending regime are however
delayed relatively to the case  = 105 (Figure 4.4). For instance, for  = 10-3

In addition, the second phase of thickening shows two different stages for
 = 1.0 and P e = 100.0, a first stage where the thickness drastically increases
and a second stage where it continues increasing but much slower (Figure 4.4).
This transition, enhanced by the new thermal boundary condition, reflects
the detachment of the thermal anomaly in the second bending phase and is
discussed in Appendix C.2.

4.3.2

Considering a more realistic rheology, effect of ()

The first order Arrhenius rheology 2 () widens the range of temperature over
which significant viscosity variation occurs, i.e.  80% of the temperature
range against  10% for 1 () (Figure 4.2).
Therefore, the effective flow viscosity starts to increase sooner and the
transition to the second bending phase occurs sooner than for the rheology
previously considered 1 () (Figure 4.5). For instance, for  = 10-3 and
P e = 1.0, while the second phase of the flow starts around t  10-5 for the
rheology 1 (), it starts around t  10-6 for the rheology 2 () (Figure 4.5).
In particular, the change in rheology almost compensates for the delay caused
by the heating of the surrounding medium. For instance, the transition time

4.3.3

Characterization of the thermal anomaly

As in Chapter 3, we quantify the size of the thermal anomaly through a critical
thermal radius Rc (t) where the temperature at the center of the flow b is
1% of the injection temperature, i.e. b (r = 0) - b (r = Rc ) = 0.99. As
expected, the thermal anomaly is larger when relaxing the thermal boundary
condition and changing the rheology () has almost no effect on its evolution
(Figure 4.6). In addition, the extent of the cold fluid region R(t) - Rc (t)
is growing slightly slower with time when considering  = 1 in comparison
to the isothermal boundary case  = 105 (Figure 4.6). In the following, we
characterize the thermal anomaly evolution in the more realistic case where
 = 1 and () = 2 ().
The size of the thermal anomaly Rc (t) is given by the radius where advection of heat is equal to heat loss

b). Therefore, the evolution of the thermal anomaly is governed by the inflation rate at the intrusion tip when relaxing the thermal boundary condition.
The cold fluid region grows slightly slower, from t9/22 to t17/44 (9/22  0.40
, 17/44  0.38) and the dependence in the Peclet number P e is weaker, i.e.
from a power 1/3 to 1/4. Indeed, for small P e, the vertical diffusion is efficient on the emplacement time scale and rapidly heats up the surrounding
medium. The heat loss in the interior are smaller and the thermal anomaly
larger in comparison to the case where  = 105 . In contrast, for large values
of P e, the advection dominates and the saving of heat due to the heating
of the surrounding medium is less important decreasing the overall difference
between small and large values of P e.
As we show in section 4.3.2, the time tb2 for the current to enter the second
bending phase does not change much as the delay induced by the heating of
the surrounding medium is offset by the change in rheology. Accordingly, we
use the time tb2 (3.63) defined in section 3.3.5 to characterize the first bending
transition (Figure 4.8 a). In contrast, the time tb3 for the current to enter the
third phase of the flow, which is defined as the time for the effective viscosity
to reach 90% of its maximum value c and depends on the evolution of the
cold fluid region (Section 3.3.5), is now larger and equal to

As in the bending regime, for a small value of , the heating of the surrounding
medium limits heat loss in the central region of the current and the thermal
anomaly extends further into the flow. For instance, for P e = 1 and  = 0.01
at t = 200, while Rc  1 for  = 105 , Rc is larger than 5 for  = 1 (Figure 4.9).
In addition, after it detaches from the current tip, the thermal anomaly does
not reach a steady-state profile but keeps growing with time instead (Figure
4.10). Indeed, in contrast to the isothermal boundary case, the constant

Figure 4.10: Snapshots of the flow thermal structure (r, z, t) at different
times indicated on the plot. Dashed lines represent the thermal boundary
layers. Solid grey lines are isotherms for  = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8. Here,
 = 0.01, P e = 1.0 and Stm = 1. The thermal structure above the intrusion is given
by (4.5) and reads in a dimensionless form r (r, z, t) =

1/2 m (z-h)
s (r, t) erfc P e r 2t where the ratio m /r is set to 1.

For small values of P e, the efficient heat conduction results in an almost
vertical isothermal current at t = 200 (Figure 4.9). In contrast, for large
values of P e, the vertical diffusion of heat is less efficient, the thermal aureole
is restricted to a small region around the intrusion, the thermal anomaly is
larger and the temperature gradient within the flow are stronger (Figure 4.9).
While three phases also characterized the dynamics when  = 1.0, their
extent and duration are modified by the new thermal boundary condition
(Figure 4.11). In particular, the current remains hot for a longer period of
time and the second phase is delayed in comparison to the case where  = 105 .
For instance, for  = 0.01 and P e = 1.0, while this transition occurs around
t = 0.1 for  = 105 , it happens only after t = 1 for  = 1 (Figure 4.11). As
the thermal anomaly does not reach a steady state for  = 1, the cooling of
the current in the second gravity phase is also slower than for  = 105 and

4.4.2

Considering a more realistic rheology, effect of ()

As in the bending regime, the chosen rheology () also affects the timing for
the phase transition, and, in particular, these transitions occur sooner for the
first order Arrhenius rheology 2 () than for  = 1 (). In particular, the delay induced in the phase transitions by the heating of the surrounding medium
is almost offset by the first order Arrhenius rheology. For instance, the transition to the second gravity phase occurs around the same time for a current
characterized by () = 1 and  = 105 than for a current characterized by
() = 2 and  = 1.0 (Figure 4.11 and 4.12).

4.4.3

Characterization of the thermal anomaly

As in the bending regime, the thermal anomaly is first attached to the tip of
the current, i.e. Rc (t)/R(t) = 1. After a time that depends on P e as well as
, the thermal anomaly detaches from the tip and follows its own evolution.
However, in contrast to the isoviscous case, the thermal anomaly does not

The time tg2 for the current to enter the second gravity phase does not
change much as the delay induced by the heating of the surrounding medium

to characterize the first gravity transition (Figure 4.14 a). In contrast, the
time tg3 for the current to enter the third phase of the flow, which is defined
as the time for the effective viscosity to reach 90% of its maximum value c
and depends on the evolution of the thermal anomaly (Section 3.4.5), is now

4.5

Evolution with bending and gravity in the
more realistic model

In the previous chapter, we showed that the final evolution of an elastic-plated
gravity current depends on the relative phase changes within each regime and
the transition between the bending and the gravity regime itself. The Arrhenius rheology tends to offset the delay caused by the heating of the surrounding
medium and overall, the phase diagram presented in section (3.5) shows only
minor modifications (Figure 4.15). Except for the transitions from the third
bending phase to the second and third gravity phases, which are shifted to the
left, the phase diagram is indeed not modified (Appendix B). Therefore, in
the framework of our more realistic model, the current is only more likely to
transition to the gravity regime before reaching the third bending phase. In
the following, we look at the observations discussed in chapter 2 in the light
of our new model.

Application to the spreading of shallow
magmatic intrusions
Elba Island christmas-tree laccolith complex

The isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current model has been used in Chapter
2 to study the laccoliths of Elba Island (Michaut, 2011). It shows that, while
their final morphology is consistent with their arrest in the bending regime,
their dimension requires unreasonable magma viscosity to agree with the isoviscous model (Chapter 2). In addition, given the fracture toughness of rocks,
their radius seems too small to be fractured controlled and their arrest might
be better explained by their cooling (Michaut, 2011). In the following, we
compare the new model predictions to the size of the laccoliths provided by
Rocchi et al. (2002). In order to account for the intrinsic scale of different
settings for each intrusion and compare them to the model, the data have
first to be nondimensionalized using characteristic values for each intrusion
parameters.
Range of values for the dimensionless numbers
The different parameters along with a discussion on the possible values for hf
have been provided in chapter 2 and are summarized in table 4.2. We refer
the reader to Section 2.3.1 for more details about their derivation. In the
following, we quantify the values of the dimensionless numbers introduced by
the cooling of the current in the setting of Elba Island laccoliths.
For a latent heat of crystallization L = 4.18 x 105 J kg-1 , a difference
between solidus temperature TS and liquidus temperature TL between 100 K
and 300 K, the number Stm varies from 0.1 to 0.5. For a thermal diffusivity
for the magma equal to m = 10-6 m s-2 , an injection rate Q0 between 0.1
and 100 m3 s-1 and an intrusion depth between 0.2 and 2.7 km, the Peclet
number varies from 10-3 to 100 and therefore, P em varies from 0.01 to 1000.
Finally, the increase in viscosity upon cooling varies from 4 to 6 for mafic
magmas and can be up to 10 orders of magnitude for felsic magmas (Shaw ,
1972; Lejeune and Richet, 1995; Giordano et al., 2008; Diniega et al., 2013).
We thus consider that the viscosity contrast  ranges from 10-4 to 10-10 .
It is generally assumed that the magma stops spreading when its crystal
content becomes close to its maximum packing, i.e.   60% (Pinkerton
and Stevenson, 1992). Beyond this point, crystal collisions dominate and the
viscosity jumps to much higher values (Lejeune and Richet, 1995; Giordano
et al., 2008). We assume that this is equivalent to e tending to c in our model.
With this assumption, the model thus predicts that a magmatic intrusion

and hf = 0.001 (Figure 4.16 a) (Marsh, 1981; Diniega et al., 2013). Varying
hf has only minor effect on the best fit viscosity contrast and is discussed in
Appendix B. Therefore, introducing the cooling in the elastic-plated gravity
current model allows to reconciliate the model predictions and the observations in the case of laccoliths (Chapter 2). In particular, the shape of the
laccolith at Elba Island is now entirely consistent with the model predictions
and therefore with their arrest in the bending regime.

respectively. The width of each cross is defined by the minimum and the

of parameters listed in table 4.2 and the injection rate Q0 and the viscosity
at the liquidus temperature h indicated on the plot. The height of the cross
corresponds to the minimum and maximum values for the viscosity contrast
obtain from (4.46) when hf = 0.001.

What can we learn from the phase diagram ?
Assuming that the intrusion stops when it reaches the third bending phase,
the phase diagram proposed in section 4.5 simplifies (Figure 4.17). It shows
that sills and laccoliths are two specific end member regions as a function of P e
and . In particular, while the top portion of the phase diagram corresponds
to magmatic intrusions more mafic in composition, the bottom should be more
representative of felsic magmatic intrusions. The boundary between the two
regions show that felsic magmatic intrusions should solidify as sills on a larger
range of number P e. Indeed, felsic magmatic intrusions tend to be thicker
than their mafic counterparts. In the framework of our model, they then stay

hot for a longer period of time and therefore, can reach the gravity regime
more easily. Given the felsic composition of Elba island laccoliths, this phase
diagram can then be used to constrain the physical parameters of the magma.
In the following, we use this approach to better constrain the injection rate
of these laccoliths at the time of emplacement.
We first compute a value for the Peclet number for each laccolith at Elba
Island using its corresponding depth of intrusion and the parameters listed
in Figure 4.16. Indeed, injecting the scales (3.23), (3.24) and (3.25) in the
expression of P e (3.33), we find that in term of the injection rate and the
depth of intrusion dc , P e reads
P e  103 dc-3/2 Q5/4 .

(4.47)

For Stm = 0.1, the intrusion depths given by Rocchi et al. (2002) and Q0 =
10 m3 s-1 , the modified Peclet number P em ranges from 1 to 6. As the
best fit range of values for the viscosity contrast, discussed in the previous
section, is  = 6.9  2.3 x 10-8 , the phase diagram thus predicts that these
laccoliths should have stop in the gravity regime indicating that we might
have overestimated the injection rate (Figure 4.17). Indeed, taking a smaller
value for the injection rate of Q0 = 0.1 m3 s-1 , reasonable for viscous felsic
magmas (Harris et al., 2000), the model predicts a larger viscosity contrast
 = 1.20.4x10-9 , still consistent with the range of expected values for felsic
magmas, and weaker Peclet numbers. Therefore, the range of values for the
dimensionless numbers now falls within the laccolith regions and is consistent
with the observations (Figure 4.17).
Is conduction cooling enough to solifidy a laccolith ?
If the laccoliths stopped spreading as soon as they reached the third phase of
the bending regime, the variance in thickness and radius in between the different intrusions should also be explained by variations in the Peclet number,
most likely due to variations in intrusion depths in this example. Indeed, the
time tb3 , necessary to reach the third phase of the bending regime, the thickness and the radius of the current at this time all depend on the combination
(,P em ) considered (see Section 4.5).
To test this hypothesis, we rescale the variables using the time tb3 (4.40)

laccolith. In term of h0 and R, the scaling law (4.46) rewrites h0  0.3R8/7
and does not depend on the dimensionless numbers anymore (Figure 4.18).
However, the different laccoliths do not collapse on the same dot after rescaling
(Figure 4.16 b). In particular, the dependence of P e of our scaling, resulting
from different intrusion depths, is not enough to explain the variability in the
size of terrestrial laccoliths. An additional cooling mechanism, amplifying the
effect of P e, is thus required to explain the exact extent of laccoliths, which
could be extraction of heat by circulation of fluid on Earth (Senger et al.,
2014). To test this hypothesis, we look at the low-slope domes on the Moon
where conduction is most likely the only source of cooling.

4.6.2

Low-slope lunar domes

Circulation of fluid in the lunar crust is more likely to be absent and the model
developed in this chapter is also appropriate for studying the cooling of lowslope lunar domes. In this section, we restrict our analysis to some specific
domes whose characteristics have been precisely revisited by Melanie Thiriet
(Purple dots Figure 2.5). Their shapes and characteristics have already been
discussed in chapter 2 and hereafter, we look at their dimension in the light
of the cooling elastic-plated gravity current model.

Chapter 4. Toward a more realistic model and its application to
108
the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions
Range of values for the dimensionless numbers
Parameters for the magma in lunar setting have been discussed in chapter 2
and are summarized in table 4.2. In particular, for a same injection rate, the
smaller gravity, together with the higher density and the smaller viscosity of
lunar magmas, leads to smaller Peclet numbers. For instance, for an intrusion
1.5 km deep, using g = 1.62 m s-2 , h = 1 Pa s and m = 2900 kg m-3
instead of g = 9.81 m s-2 , h = 106 Pa s and m = 2500 kg m-3 leads to a
Peclet number two orders of magnitude smaller on the Moon than on Earth,
i.e. P e = 0.04 and P e = 1.8 respectively. However, injection rates on the
Moon are also more likely to be larger than on Earth. For an injection rate
one to two orders of magnitude larger and d between 0.5 and 1.5 km, the range
of Peclet number are in fact very similar, i.e. from 10-3 to 104 . Therefore,
taking Stm = 0.1, we have P em that varies between 0.01 and 105 for low-slope
lunar domes. Finally, lunar basalt are mafic in composition and the viscosity
contrast  should vary between 10-3 and 10-5 (Diniega et al., 2013).

Constraining the magma physical properties
For an injection rate of Q0 = 10 m3 s-1 and the parameters listed in Table
4.2, the low-slope lunar dome dimensions are also consistent with a viscosity
contrast of 8 order of magnitudes (best fit:  = 1.80.4x10-8 ) (Figure 4.16).
Assuming that the intrusion depth ranges from 500 m to 5 km, the Peclet
number ranges from 0.1 to 1 and the range of values for the dimensionless
number falls at the boundary between the two domains in the phase diagram
(Figure 4.17). It is consistent with the radius of these lunar domes being
close to R = 4, i.e. close to the transition radius with the gravity regime
(Figure 4.16). However, the estimate for the viscosity contrast is much larger
than the value expected for mafic magmas. For the same injection rate and
a viscosity for the magma at liquidus temperature of h = 103 Pa s instead
of h = 1 Pa s, the model predicts a viscosity contrast close to 5 orders of
magnitudes ( = 6.9  1.8 x 10-6 ), much closer to the expected value (Figure
4.17). A similar value for the viscosity contrast can be obtained for h = 1
Pa s and Q0 = 1500 m3 s-1 . However, in that case, the Peclet numbers are
much larger and the range of values for the dimensionless numbers fall within
the sill region (Figure 4.17). Therefore, it suggests that the injection rates
for these lunar domes were most likely close to Q0  10 m3 s-1 , hence a few
orders of magnitude smaller than the effusion rates estimated from the runout
distances of some lava flows in the lunar maria i.e. Q0  106 m3 s-1 (Gregg
and Fink , 1996).

Is conductive cooling enough to solidify a laccolith on the Moon ?
On the Moon, the dimensionless sizes of the domes vary by less than one
order of magnitude and might be explain only by the conductive cooling of the
magmatic intrusion (Figure 4.16). However, the depth of these intrusions have
not yet been reported by Wohler et al. (2009) and hence, we can not proceed
as for Elba Island laccoliths to test this hypothesis. Instead, we estimate a

range of intrusion depth that would produce a collapse of the rescaled size of
the domes, i.e. h0 as a function of R. Indeed, assuming that the different
lunar domes differ only by their intrusion depth, R = Rr implies that
dc = (R/Rr )34/15 drc

(4.49)

where the radii are with dimension and the topscript r denotes a reference
dome. We take the largest dome as a reference and we set its depth to the
largest reasonable value, i.e. dc = 5 km, mainly to ensure that the dimensionless radius of the other domes remains smaller than 4. Injecting the dome
radii in (4.49) then give intrusion depths between 0.5 km and 5 km and Peclet
numbers between 10-2 and 0.5, consistent with the expected values. However, while this new parameters result in the collapse of R for the different

Chapter 4. Toward a more realistic model and its application to

the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions
domes, the variation in Peclet number can not account for the dispersion in
the dome thicknesses (Figure 4.19). In addition, the dimensionless thickness
as a function of the dimensionless radius does not follow the scaling law (4.46)
anymore (Figure 4.19). The same observations are obtained using different
reference domes or by setting the constrain on the rescaled thickness instead
of the radius, i.e. h = hr . Therefore, conductive cooling does not appear to
be responsible for the arrest of terrestrial laccoliths.

4.6.3

Large mafic sills

As we discussed in chapter 2, the size of large mafic sills reported by Cruden
et al. (2012) show an increasing thickness with diameter apparently in contradiction with the constant thickness predicted by the elastic-plated gravity
current model (Figure 2.5). One possible explanation is that different sills
are characterized by different injection rates, i.e. by different height scales.
Forcing the dimensionless thicknesses of different sills to be constant imposes
that
Q0 = (h0 /hr0 )4 Qr
(4.50)
where h0 is the sill thickness with dimension, Q0 its injection rate and hr0
and Qr0 are reference values for this parameters. Taking the thickest sill as
a reference with Qr0 = 104 m3 s-1 , we find that in order to collapse all the
data on a constant thickness, the injection rate have to vary by at least 7
orders of magnitudes, i.e. from Q0 = 10-3 to Q0 = 104 m3 s-1 . It is much
larger than the expected range of variations for this parameter and hence,
these mafic sills do not appear to have all stop in the third gravity regime.
Another possible explanation is that fracturation at the tip, instead of cooling,
have triggered the arrest of these magmatic intrusions in the second gravity
phase. Indeed, while fracturation is not sufficient to stop a magmatic intrusion
in the bending regime, it might be responsible for the arrest of large mafic
sills (Michaut, 2011). The increasing thickness with diameter would thus be
consistent with the thickness increase induced by the cooling of the sill in the
second gravity phase. However, more information about the intrusion depth
and the relationship between the different sill units, which are not given by
Cruden et al. (2012), would be required to precisely test this hypothesis.

4.6.4

Contact aureole

Contact metamorphism often occurs in the vicinity of magmatic intrusion
(Jaeger , 1959; Sillitoe and Thompson, 1998; Senger et al., 2014). Metamorphism is a complex process and in the following, we discuss only the dimension

third bending regime.

We define the thickness of the thermal aureole by the region where r >
0.1 above the center of the flow. Therefore, inverting (4.5) gives Lh (t), the
maximum thickness of the thermal aureole above the intrusion

s (r = 0, t)
Lh scales as P e-1/2 and hence, is larger for small values of P e (Figure 4.20).
Indeed, for large P e, advection dominates on the emplacement time scale and
the thermal aureole is restricted to a small zone around the current (Figure
4.20). For instance, the thickness of the contact aureole Lh (t) at t = 10 is
almost equal to the current thickness h0 for P e = 1 whereas it is only a few
percent of h0 for P e = 10.0 (Figure 4.3).
The dimension of the thermal aureole also depends on the emplacement
time t; the longer the injection, the more heated the wall rocks and the larger
the thermal aureole. We have shown that laccoliths have most likely stopped
in the third bending phase and a lower estimate for the emplacement time as
a function of P e and  is given by tb3 (4.40). Injecting (4.40) into (4.51) gives

While the absolute size of the thermal aureole Lm increases with decreasing P e
and  (4.52), the ratio Lm /h0 is smaller for larger viscosity contrasts (Figure
4.21).
For the felsic laccoliths at Elba Island, we estimated   10-9 and P e 
10-3 (Figure 4.21 a) and thus, the thermal aureole should reach 300% of the
intrusion thickness at the center of the flow. Important temperature variations
however, i.e. r > 0.8, should be restricted to the vicinity of the current, i.e.
 50% of the intrusion thickness (Figure 4.21 b). Theses estimates represent
upper bound as the temperature at the surface s (r = 0, t) is most likely
smaller than 1 for P e < 0.1. In addition, the model neither accounts for
horizontal thermal conduction, nor for circulation of fluid in the wall rocks,
both effects that should also limit the size of the thermal aureole.

Summary and discussion

In this chapter, we discuss a more realistic model for the emplacement of
magmatic intrusions in the shallow crust of terrestrial planets. In particular,
we describe the dynamics of a magma characterized by an Arrhenius rheology
and heating the wall rocks as it spreads. We show that relaxing the thermal
boundary condition retains the heat within the flow and therefore, allows the
intrusion to stay hot for a longer period of time. In particular, the thermal
anomaly detaches slower from the tip of the intrusion. It also does not reach a

4.7. Summary and discussion

113

steady state anymore in the gravity regime as the heating of the surrounding
medium constantly decreases the heat loss in the central region. Nevertheless,
the Arrhenius rheology largely compensates for the delay in the transitions
induced by the heating of the surrounding medium. At the end, except for
the third phase in both regimes which is reached slightly later, the dynamics
shows only small variations in comparison to the one described in chapter 3.
Application of this model to the christmas-tree laccolith complex at Elba
Island shows that cooling allows to reconciliate the elastic-plated gravity current model with the observations. Indeed, their size is consistent with their
felsic composition (  10-8 ) and their arrest in the third bending phase.
However, the model does not capture the second order variation in the laccolith dimensions. Indeed, while the mean trend in the data is consistent
with the model, conduction alone is not able to explain the variability around
this trend. Further application to low-slope lunar domes, where conduction is
more likely to be the only cooling mechanism, leads to the same conclusions.
The model thus suggests that other mechanism than cooling are responsible
for the arrest of laccoliths.
In the end, while some progress has been made in the understanding of
the emplacement of these shallow magmatic intrusions, a complete picture of
the solution, in regard to the evolution of the size and thickness of the intrusion as a function of the parameters of the problem (elasticity and toughness
of the host rock, viscosity of the magma, injection rate of the feeder dyke,
and depth of emplacement), has not yet been obtained. In general, more detailed observations, especially at the tip of these shallow magmatic intrusions,
may provide further insights in the arrest mechanism. Precise information
on the extent of the thermal aureole, which has not yet been reported in the
literature, could also provide precious constrain for the model.

Lunar Floor-Fractured Craters (FFCs) are a class of craters modified by
post impact mechanisms. They are defined by distinctive shallow floors that
are convex or plate-like, sometimes with a wide floor moat bordering the wall
region. Radial, concentric and polygonal floor fractures suggest an endogenous process of modification. Two mechanisms have been proposed to account
for such deformations: viscous relaxation and spreading of a magma intrusion

118

Chapter 5. Floor-fractured craters

at depth below the crater. To test the second assumption and bring more
constraints on the intrusion process, we develop a model for the dynamics of
magma spreading below an elastic overlying layer with a crater-like topography. As predicted in precedent more qualitative studies, the increase in lithostatic pressure at the crater wall zone prevents the intrusion from spreading
laterally, leading to the thickening of the intrusion. Additionally, our model
shows that the final crater floor appearance after the uplift, that could be convex or flat, with or without a circular moat bordering the wall zone, depends
on the elastic thickness of the layer overlying the intrusion and on the crater
size. As a result, our model provides a simple formula to derive the elastic
thickness of the layer overlying the intrusion, and hence a minimum estimate
for the intrusion depth. Finally, our model suggests that crust redistribution
by cratering must have controlled magma ascent below most of these craters.

5.1

Introduction

A large fraction of the magma produced by mantle melting never reaches the
surface as it intrudes the shallow layers of the planet. On Earth, the volume
of intrusive magma is estimated to be 10 times (resp. 5 times) the volume of
extrusive lava for the continental crust (resp. the oceanic crust) (Crisp, 1984).
Buoyancy is the main mechanism driving up the magma from the interior to
the shallow layers or the surface of the planets. It has been shown that dykes
stop their propagation when they become neutrally buoyant relative to their
surroundings (Walker , 1989; Rivalta et al., 2005; Taisne and Jaupart, 2009).
Therefore, the intrusive to extrusive ratio largely depends on the respective
density of the crust and magma.
The density of the lunar crust is particularly low. The last estimate from
the GRAIL NASA mission provides for a mean density for the highlands
of 2550 kg.m-3 , even lower than what was previously assumed (Wieczorek
et al., 2013). Both the light anorthite minerals that form the lunar crust
and impact induced fractures and brecciation contribute to its low density
(Wilhelms et al., 1987). Given the large density of magma inferred from the
composition of the mare basalts that are generally rich in FeO and TiO2
(Wieczorek et al., 2001), the intrusive to extrusive ratio on the Moon might
be even higher than on Earth (El-Baz , 1970; Wilson and Head III , 1981;
Hiesinger , 2006; Glotch et al., 2010). Head and Wilson (1992) estimated an
upper limit of 50 : 1 for this ratio. However, there are no solid constraints
supporting this estimate and although it is an important parameter in lunar
thermal evolution models (Laneuville et al., 2013), it is poorly constrained.
Extrusions of lava preferentially occurred within large impact basins on

5.1. Introduction

119

the near side of the Moon where a large fraction of the low-density crust
has been removed. However, the trajectory of the magma from its source to
the surface is unknown. The magma could have ascended directly from the
source to the surface (Wieczorek et al., 2001); alternatively, it might have first
accumulated at the crust-mantle interface before erupting where the crust was
thinner (Wilson and Head III , 1981).
Possible sites for intrusions on the Moon are below floor-fractured craters
(FFCs). These craters have been identified by Schultz (1976a); they have shallow floors with a plate-like or convex appearance, wide floor moats and radial,
concentric and polygonal floor fractures. Schultz (1976a) has classified about
200 FFCs. Similar FFCs have been observed on Mercury (Head et al., 2008),
Mars (Schultz , 1978; Schultz and Glicken, 1979; Sato et al., 2010) and Venus
(Wichman and Schultz , 1995a). The database and classification proposed by
Schultz (1976a) have recently been updated by Jozwiak et al. (2012) who used
new data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC). The deformations affecting these craters
are contained within the crater interior. Two mechanisms have been proposed
to explain the features observed at FFCs: 1) spreading of a magmatic intrusion at depth below the crater floor (Schultz , 1976a; Wichman and Schultz ,
1993, 1995b, 1996; Jozwiak et al., 2012) and 2) viscous relaxation of the crater
floor induced by a local thermal gradient caused by the impact (Hall et al.,
1981). However, viscous relaxation of the crater floor has been modeled by
Dombard and Gillis (2001) but, for typical elastic parameters, the lunar crust
is too rigid and shallowing of craters smaller than 100 km is not significant.
Hence, if the deformations observed at FFCs resulted indeed from magmatic
intrusion, they might give us important constraints and clues on the process
of magmatic intrusion in the lunar crust.
The classical, static, model of laccoliths of Pollard and Johnson (1973) has
previously been applied to the case of FFCs to deduce the intrusion depth and
magma pressure (Wichman and Schultz , 1993, 1996; Jozwiak et al., 2012). In
this static model, the intrusion radius is known a priori. The intrusion shape
is controlled by the elastic deformation of a thin elastic layer on top of the
laccolith and the elastic pressure necessary for deforming the overlying layer
is assumed to be equilibrated by magma weight. However, Michaut (2011)
and Bunger and Cruden (2011) have shown that, if the elastic deformation
of the overlying layer controls the flow shape and its dynamics during a first
spreading phase, the own weight of the flow becomes dominant during a second
phase where the flow shape shows a flat top. Furthermore, in all these models,
the possible effect of a thickening of the overlying layer has been ignored.
Here, we modify the model proposed by Michaut (2011) for the dynamics
of a magma intrusion below an elastic overlying layer in order to account for

120

Chapter 5. Floor-fractured craters

the effects of the crater topography, i.e. for an overlying layer of variable
thickness. We show that different types of deformations of the crater floor
are expected, as initially predicted by Schultz (1976a), and that they mainly
depend on the elastic thickness of the layer overlying the intrusion and on the
crater size.

5.2

Floor-fractured craters

Floor-fractured craters are craters that have undergone endogenous deformations after the impact. About two hundreds FFCs have been observed on
the Moon and precisely described by Schultz (1976a) who studied their structure and geology using Lunar Orbiter and Apollo stereo sets. Schultz (1976a)
proposed a classification into 6 categories based on their sizes, morphological
features and degrees of modification; classification which has recently been
updated by Jozwiak et al. (2012) using the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter
(LOLA) and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) (Table 5.1).
Radial and concentric fracture networks generally cross the floors of these
craters (Schultz , 1976a). Another striking feature of FFCs is their shallow
floors: except for class 1 FFCs, they all exhibit a significant shallowing of
their floors compared to fresh craters the same size (Schultz , 1976a; Jozwiak
et al., 2012).
Floor uplift mainly results in two different modes of crater floor appearance
(Schultz , 1976a). In particular, FFCs of classes 3 and 5 show a flat central
floor, characteristic of a piston-like uplift of the crater floor; additionally, a
large circular U-shaped moat adjacent to the wall zone borders the flat floor
of class 3 FFCs (Schultz , 1976a; Jozwiak et al., 2012). A typical example of a
class 3 FFC is the crater Warner, which is 35 km in diameter and is located
at 4.0 S, 87.3 E in the southern part of the Mare Smythii (Figure 5.1 b). In
contrast, the floors of craters of classes 2 and 4 appear convex, indicating
a different mechanism of crater floor uplift (Schultz , 1976a; Jozwiak et al.,
2012). Briggs is a good archetype of class 2 FFC, it is a crater of 37 km in
diameter and is located at 26.5 N, 69.1 W, in the western part of the Oceanus
Procellarum (Figure 5.1 a). Craters showing a convex floor may also exhibit
moats adjacent to their wall zone but these are V-shaped; this is the case for
classes 4a, 4b and 4c FFCs. In addition, craters of class 4b also exhibit an
inner wall zone.
Finally, class 1 FFCs show only limited deformations while the floor of
class 6 FFCs has been flooded by mare lavas, illustrating the close relationship between magmatism and deformations at these craters (Schultz , 1976a;
Jozwiak et al., 2012).

An axisymmetric model for a magmatic intrusion spreading below a crater-like topography

In this model, we consider the spreading of an axisymmetric intrusion above
a rigid layer and below a thin overlying layer with a crater-like topography.

5.3.1

Crater topography and overlying layer characteristics

On the Moon, fresh impact craters have been classified into three categories according to their shapes following crater formation and collapse: simple craters,
complex craters and basins (Pike, 1974; Schultz , 1976b; Pike, 1980; Baker
et al., 2011). Simple craters are bowl-shaped craters that do not exhibit any
slope-break (Pike, 1980). With increasing diameter, impact craters transition to complex craters that are characterized by an inner flat floor, terraced
rims and a central peak. On the Moon, the transition from simple to complex craters occurs at a diameter of  15 km (Pike, 1980; Hiesinger , 2006;
O'Keefe and Ahrens, 1999; Kalynn et al., 2013). Although not all do, most
craters larger than 100 km exhibit rings on their flat floors and are defined as
basins (Wilhelms et al., 1987; Schultz , 1988). In our model, we do not consider basins and study the spreading of a magmatic intrusion at depth below
simple and complex craters.
In this model, we account for the effects of the crater topography on the
intrusion dynamics. The normalized sigmoid function (r) is used to parameterize the crater topography

(r) =

(5.1)

1 + e Dc

where Dc is the intrusion depth, C the crater radius, defined as the distance
from the crater center to the center of the wall zone, and  the average slope
of the wall zone (Figure 5.2). The elevation in height relatively to the crater
center, i.e the crater topography, is then given by
Tp (r) = Dc (r)

(5.2)

and results in an increase in lithostatic pressure at the crater wall zone.
For simple craters, our definition of the crater radius C corresponds to half
of the observed crater radius. Pike (1980) shows that the average wall slope
 increases gradually from about 0.3 (19 ), for craters 0.5 km in diameter,
to 0.4 (25 ) for craters 15 km in diameter (Kalynn et al., 2013). To model a
simple crater, we thus use Dc /4C = 0.25 (Figure 5.2 a), which, for C = 2.5
km and  = 0.4 (25 ) gives a corresponding Dc of 1 km in agreement with
Pike (1980). For complex craters, the size of the central flat floor, relatively
to the crater radius, increases from 25%, for a crater 20 km in diameter, to
50%, for a crater that is 100 km crater in diameter. The wall of complex
craters exhibits walls at the angle of repose ( 30 ), terraces, and hilly toes
that combine to form a wall zone of effective slope value that decreases from
 = 0.5 (30 ) to  = 0.2 (12 ) as the crater diameter increases from 20 to 100

km (Pike, 1980; Bray et al., 2008; Kalynn et al., 2013). To model a complex
crater, we use a ratio Dc /4C = 0.13 (Figure 5.2 b) which, for C = 14 km
and  = 0.4, i.e. a crater that is 40 km in diameter, gives Dc = 3 km in
agreement with Pike (1980) and Kalynn et al. (2013).
Impact induces fracture and brecciation beneath the crater floor (Wilhelms et al., 1987; Melosh, 1989; Jolliff et al., 2000) and also causes melting
and compaction of the pores (Melosh, 1989; Schultz , 1976a). If the melt-

5.3. An axisymmetric model for a magmatic intrusion spreading

125
ing during impact is negligible and the neutral buoyancy zone of the magma
lies immediately beneath an impact brecciated lens, as is commonly assumed
(Schultz , 1976a; Wichman and Schultz , 1996; Jozwiak et al., 2012), the overlying layer would not respond elastically due to its lack of coherent structure.
We consider the case of a strengthless overlying layer with a crater like topography given by (5.2) in Section 5.4.1. However, a coherent impact melt unit
commonly stands on top of the brecciated lens (Melosh, 1989; Schultz , 1976a).
The neutral buoyancy zone of the magma depends on the crust and magma
density and could also be situated deeper than the bottom of the brecciated
lens. As a result, the overlying layer would deform elastically above the intrusion. In our model, we thus consider the case of an overlying layer with an
elastic thickness Te (r) that varies with radial coordinate r and thickens at the
crater wall zone (Figure 5.3). The elastic layer is characterized by a Young's
modulus E and a Poisson's ratio . For simplicity, the thickness of the elastic
layer, showing a simple or a complex crater topography, is considered to be
equal to the intrusion depth and is given by
Te (r) = Te0 (1 + (r))

(5.3)

where  = Dc /Te0 is the ratio of the crater depth Dc to the intrusion depth
at the center Te0 and characterizes the thickening of the upper elastic layer
at the crater wall zone. As a result of this assumption, the intrusion depth
is underestimated in the model, but if a constant thickness brecciated layer
overlies the intrusion and underlies such an elastic layer, it does not have any
effect on the intrusion dynamics. The crater topography Tp is then given by
Tp (r) = Te (r) - Te0 = Te0 (r) = Dc (r).

(5.4)

Central peaks are common features of complex craters. Their dimensions
depend on both projectile and target properties as well as on the impact angle
(Schultz et al., 1994; Bray et al., 2008). However, their width can reach one
fourth of the crater floor and they can be as high as half of the crater depth;
hence such a structure could influence the intrusion dynamics. The effect of
a central peak on the spreading of an intrusion is examined in Appendix D.
Moreover, a raised rim, uplifted relative to the pre-impact surface, is usually
present at the exterior of the crater wall zone (Pike, 1976, 1980). Although,
for simplicity, we do not model the effect of this feature, we discuss its possible
influence on intrusion emplacement in Section 5.5.3.

5.3.2

Equations of Motion

We assume that the flow spreads along a thin bedding plane and neglect
fracturing at the tip. The magma is considered to behave as a newtonian fluid

126

Chapter 5. Floor-fractured craters

with a constant viscosity  and density m . The intrusion is fed at a constant
rate through a cylindrical conduit of diameter a. The vertical coordinate z is
oriented upward (Figure 5.3).

Figure 5.3: Sketch of the intrusion spreading below an impact crater topography. Dc (resp. C) represents the initial depth (resp. radius) of the impact crater. The intrusion spreads above a rigid homogeneous and horizontal
bedrock at depth Te (r) below the crater floor. At the center, the intrusion
depth is noted Te0 .

5.3.2.1

Momentum equation

The dynamics of the flow is given by the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in cylindrical geometry. The magma has a relatively large viscosity, hence
the flow is in a laminar regime and the inertia terms can be neglected. The
intrusion develops over a length scale comparable to the crater size that is
much larger than its thickness H (C >> H), hence the lubrication assumption allows further simplifications (Huppert, 1982a; Michaut and Bercovici ,
2009). The Navier-Stokes equations in the radial and vertical directions for
an axisymmetric, incompressible flow of newtonian fluid resume to

Integration of (5.6) gives the pressure within the flow
P (r, t) = m g(h(r, t) - z) + c gTe (r) + Pe (r, t)

(5.7)

where h(r, t) is the intrusion thickness and c is the overlying layer density.
The pressure is the sum of three different contributions: the weight of the
magma and of the overlying layer and the elastic pressure Pe due to the
deformation of the overlying elastic layer. In the absence of radial forces
within the elastic plate, the elastic pressure required for bending the plate is
given by the force per unit area that is necessary for a vertical displacement
h of the thin elastic plate (Turcotte and Schubert, 1982)

Pe (r, t) = 2r D(r)2r h(r)

boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the intrusion, i.e. uz=0 =
uz=h = 0, we get the radial velocity within the flow

As expected, this evolution equation accounts for four different contributions.
The first term on the right hand side represents gravitational spreading of the
intrusion; except for a constant arising from a no-slip boundary at the top of
the flow, it is the same as for a gravity current (Huppert, 1982a). This term is
negative and induces magma spreading. The second term is associated with
the increase in lithostatic pressure at the crater wall zone and represents the
lithostatic barrier the flow has to face when spreading below the crater wall
zone; it is not present in the case of an overlying layer of constant thickness
(Michaut, 2011). This term is positive and opposes to the flow. The third
term represents squeezing of the flow in response to the elastic deformation of
the overlying layer. This term is negative and induces spreading in the case
of an elastic layer of constant thickness (Michaut, 2011). However, in the case
of a layer that thickens with r, it can become positive and oppose to the flow
if the thickening is rapid and important, i.e. at the crater wall zone. The last
term represents the injection rate.

5.3.3

Nondimensionalization

Because the model depends on a large set of parameters (see Table 5.2), we
nondimensionalize the flow equation (5.13) using the crater radius C, as defined in Section 5.3.1, as the characteristic length scale, as well as a height
scale H and a time scale  given by

The height scale and the time scale are defined by equating the nondimensional
group in front of the gravity current term to 1, i.e., ( m gH 3 )/(12C 2 ) = 1.
The height scale H is the characteristic height scale of a gravity current flow
(Huppert, 1982a).  is the time scale for a gravity current to fill in the crater;
it mainly depends on the injection rate. In the case of an upper layer with

constant thickness Te0 , a characteristic length scale for the flow is the flexural

it represents the wavelength over which the upper layer deforms elastically.
However, in this problem, the crater radius C imposes a horizontal length
scale to the flow, as the lithostatic barrier the flow faces at the wall zone
imposes a limitation to the intrusion spreading. The choice of C as the length
scale is then more relevant. Variables are then written as:
r = Cr

h = Hh

t =  t

(5.17)

where r , h and t are the dimensionless radius, thickness and time. Substituting (5.17) into (5.13) and dropping the stars, we finally get the dimensionless equation for the flow:

The number  represents the dimensionless source width. The number  is

discussed in Section 5.3.1. The number  is the ratio between the lithostatic
pressure increase at the crater wall zone and the hydrostatic pressure due to a
magma column of thickness H. The number  is the dimensionless thickening
of the upper elastic layer at the crater wall zone, as described in Section 5.3.1.
Finally, the number  is the dimensionless flexural wavelength of the upper
layer elevated to the power 4; it quantifies the length scale over which the
elastic deformation is effective relative to the crater radius.
Additionnally, we define a last dimensionless number 
=

(5.25)

which is the ratio between the magma and crust density. The value of  is
set equal to 1.2. The dimensionless topography is then given by:
Tp (r) = (r)

(5.26)

To obtain the crater floor appearance in the different figures, we add to
the dimensionless expression of the topography, the dimensionless thickness
h(r) of the intrusion.

5.3.4

Range of values for the dimensionless numbers

For a conduit diameter varying between 10 and 100 m and a crater radius
between 10 and 50 km, the normalized source width  (5.20) varies between
10-5 and 10-2 (Table 5.3). Its variation does not significantly influence the
results and in particular, does not play on the shape of the intrusion (Michaut,
2011) ; it is fixed at a value of 0.02 in this study. For a Young's modulus
between 1 and 10 GPa, a gravity of 1.62 m.s-2 , a magma density m between
2800 and 3200 kg.m-3 and an elastic thickness Te0 ranging from 0.5 to 5 km,
the flexural wavelength of the upper layer , given by (5.16), varies between
1 and 12 km (Table 5.2). Accordingly, for complex craters between 20 and
100 km in diameter, our length scale C is between 6 km and 40 km and the
number  takes values between 10-7 and 1 (Table 5.3). For simple craters
between 10 and 20 km in diameter, the number  is between 10-3 and 10.
For complex craters, the crater depth ranges from 2 to 4 km and the
number  varies between 0.3 and 8 for intrusions between 0.5 and 5 km
depth. For simple craters 1 to 2 km deep, this number is between 0.2 and 4
(Table 5.3). Additionally, we use  = 0.25 for simple craters and  = 0.13
for complex craters (see Section 3.1). Hence, we investigate the influence of
four dimensionless numbers on the flow dynamics: the number , through the
effect of 2 end-member topographies (see Section 3.1), and the numbers , 
and .

conservation as a test for the accuracy of the convergence. We first examine
the case of an intrusion below a strengthless overlying layer and a thickness
that varies radially according to (5.3). We then consider the case of an intrusion that lies beneath an elastic layer whose thickness is also given by (5.3).

which corresponds to (5.18) without the elastic term.
We first consider an intrusion below a complex crater characterized by a
topography given by (5.19) using  = 0.13. In that case, at the crater wall, the
overlying layer thickens and the flow faces an increase in lithostatic pressure
which becomes more important as  increases. To examine the effect of the
lithostatic pressure increase at the wall zone on the intrusion spreading, we
consider  = 0.13 and different values of  = 20, 50 and 200 in (5.27).
Up to t = 1, the flow spreads as a classical gravity current below a flat floor
as the lithostastic term (i.e. second term on the right hand side of (5.27)) is
negligible. In this regime, the flow thickness goes toward a constant, noted Hg ,
of order 1 (which depends on the source width (Michaut and Bercovici , 2009))
while the radius evolves as t1/2 as predicted by the gravity current theory
(Huppert, 1982a) (Figure 5.4 a, b). The intrusion shows a characteristic flat
top profile with a steep front (Figure 5.4 c). When the intrusion reaches the
wall zone, at t  1, the lithostatic pressure increase prevents the intrusion
from spreading laterally. The second term on the right of (5.27) is positive, it
increases with  and causes the thickening of the intrusion (Figure 5.4 a, c).
In this thickening regime, the edge radius remains close to a constant (Figure
5.4 b). At the surface, the thickening of the flat top intrusion results in an
important piston-like uplift of the crater floor. However, no moat is formed
adjacent to the wall zone (Figure 5.4 c).
In contrast to complex craters, the topography of simple craters, and hence
the lithostatic pressure, gradually increases from the center to the exterior of
the crater wall zone. We use  = 0.25 and  = 20 in (5.27). In that case,
there is no gravity current phase; the gradual lithostatic pressure increase
slows down the spreading from the beginning and induces a gradual thickening
phase (Figure 5.4 d, e, f). The intrusion shape almost accommodates the

topography (Figure 5.4 f). Indeed, because the overlying layer is less dense
than the magma, the crater floor appears slightly concave up, the concavity
increasing with the density difference between the overlying layer and the
magma, i.e. on  (Figure 5.4 f).
For both types of craters, the phase of thickening ends when the hydrostatic pressure due to the weight of the magma equals the lithostatic pressure
outside of the wall zone, i.e. h0  . When h0 becomes larger than , the
gravity current term compensates for the lithostatic term in (5.27) and the
intrusion can flow down the wall zone and return in a gravity current regime
(Figure 5.4 a, b, d, e). In the gravity current regime, the flow evolves toward a
constant value equal to  + Hg . Thus, for a constant injection rate, the number  mostly controls the final intrusion thickness and hence the shallowing
of the crater floor. However, the injection rate might decrease as the intrusion
grows, as the intrusion weight compensates for the overpressure at the origin
of magma ascent. This effect should control the final shallowing of the crater
floor and is discussed in Section 5.4.5.

5.4.2

Intrusion below an elastic layer of constant thickness

In the previous section, we considered that the intrusion stalls beneath a
highly fractured and brecciated zone with no strength. However, an impact
melt unit might be present on top of the brecciated lens. Furthermore, the
intrusion might also emplace deeper than the brecciated lens; both cases imply
the deformation of an upper coherent elastic layer during the spreading of the
intrusion. In Michaut (2011), the model was developed for an upper elastic
layer of constant thickness in a 2D Cartesian geometry and the behavior of
the flow was predicted for an axisymmetric geometry. Here, we first show
the results for an elastic layer with a constant thickness in an axisymmetric
geometry and verify the predictions of Michaut (2011). In the next sections,
we examine the case of an upper elastic layer with a crater-like topography
and a thickness that varies with the radius according to (5.3).
We first solve Equation (5.18) using  = 1,  = 0 and  = 0, i.e. Te (r) =

constant thickness. Equation (5.18) becomes:

of (5.28), cause spreading. As expected, the intrusion dynamics follows two
different spreading regimes (Michaut, 2011; Michaut et al., 2013; Bunger and
Cruden, 2011). During the first phase, the thickening is important and the
intrusion shows a bell-shaped profile (Figure 5.5 a, c). As shown by Michaut
(2011), the flow dynamics is controlled by the elastic deformation of the overlying layer up to a radius R = 4. In this regime, the elastic pressure is dominant over the pressure due to magma weight. In the magma, the pressure is
constant below the elastic layer, except at the tip (Bunger and Cruden, 2011;
Michaut, 2011), which explains the bell-shaped profile of the intrusion (Figure
5.5 c). Indeed, for a constant pressure Pd in the magma, Pe (r) = D4r h = Pd

by (5.9). Results show that the thickness and radius evolve with time with
an exponent close to 1/3, as predicted by Michaut (2011) when neglecting
the gravity current term and considering a constant injection rate (Figure 5.5
a, b). Beyond R = 4, the size of the intrusion becomes much larger than
the flexural parameter and the gravitational term becomes prevalent in the
dynamics. The intrusion thus transitions to a gravity current regime characterized by a flat top profile (Figure 5.5 d). In this regime, the flow thickness
evolves toward a constant Hg while the radius follows t1/2 as predicted by the
gravity current theory (Huppert, 1982a) (Figure 5.5 a, b). The elastic term
is negligible when considering the dynamics of the whole flow in this regime.
However, the overlying layer is unable to accommodate the steep front of a
typical gravity current flow (Huppert, 1982a) and the intrusion develops a
small scale bent edge whose width is equal to 4 (Figure 5.5 d).

5.4.3

Spreading beneath a complex crater topography

In this section, we consider an intrusion below an elastic overlying layer with
a complex crater topography, hence we use  = 0.13 in (5.19). We first
examine the effect of varying the dimensionless flexural parameter, i.e. the
dimensionless number  and then examine the influence of the thickening at
the wall by varying the number .
5.4.3.1

Effect of the dimensionless flexural parameter (effect of )

We consider equation (5.18) for which we set  = 20 and  = 0.3 and consider
two different values of the dimensionless flexural parameter  = 10-2 and
 = 10-5 . Up to t  1, the central flat floor of the crater acts as a constant
thickness upper layer and the lithostatic term (second term on the right hand
side of (5.18)) is negligible.
For  = 10-2 , the flexural wavelength is close to the crater size, i.e. 4 
C. The intrusion spreads in an elastic regime below the crater flat floor, the
dimensionless radius and dimensionless thickness evolve close to t1/3 (Figure
5.6) and the intrusion shows a characteristic bell-shaped profile (Figure 5.7 a).
At t  1, the second term on the right hand side of (5.18), representing the
lithostatic pressure increase at the crater wall zone, becomes important and
opposes to the flow. The intrusion enters in a thickening dominated regime,
where the thickness increases significantly and the radius remains close to
constant (Figure 5.6 and 5.7 a), while it has not yet transitioned into a gravity
current regime and still shows a bell shape. The thickening of the bell-shaped
intrusion results in a convex uplift of the crater floor (Figure 5.7 a).
For  = 10-5 , the intrusion first spreads in an elastic regime and the di-

mensionless radius and thickness evolve as t1/3 (Figure 5.6). However, the
flexural wavelength is much smaller than the crater size in this case (i.e.
4 << C). The flow transitions to a gravity current regime far in front of the
wall zone, at t = 0.06, which is evident as, beyond this time, the dimensionless
radius evolves as t1/2 while the dimensionless thickness goes toward a constant
(Figure 5.6 a and b). In consequence, the intrusion shows a flat top profile and
a small scale bent edge while reaching the crater wall zone (Figure 5.7 b). At
t  1, the lithostatic pressure increase prevents the intrusion from spreading
radially and the intrusion thickens. The thickening of the flat top intrusion
results in a piston-like uplift of the central part of the crater floor (Figure 5.6
a and 5.7 b) as in the previous case of a gravity current below a strengthless
overlying layer (Figure 5.4 c). However, the bending of the upper layer above
the intrusion at its edge leads to the formation of a circular moat, adjacent to
the wall zone, whose extent corresponds to the size of the intrusion edge and
is  4 (Figure 5.7 b).
The thickening rate of the intrusion, as it reaches the wall zone, depends
on its spreading regime (Figure 5.6 a, b) and hence on the value of . For
larger values of , the elastic pressure that squeezes the flow is more important
and it is easier for the magma to overcome the lithostatic barrier and spread
below the wall zone. In any case, when the sum of the pressures due to
elastic bending of the overlying layer and to magma weight compensates for
the hydrostatic pressure due to the crater wall zone weight, the flow passes
the wall zone. For both values of , as it passes down the wall zone, the
intrusion is in a gravity current regime as R is or becomes larger than 4:
the radius evolves as t1/2 and the thickness evolves toward the final value of
 + Hg (Figure 5.6 a, b).
5.4.3.2

Effect of the local increase in the flexural parameter at the
wall zone (effect of )

Due to the elastic thickness increase at the crater wall zone, the flexural
wavelength of the overlying elastic layer increases from  at the crater center
to a value equal to

beyond the wall zone. To understand the effect of the local increase in flexural
wavelength at the wall zone, we consider a constant value of the number
 = 20 and increasing values of the number  = 0.3, 3, 6 for the two different
values of the number  = 10-2 and  = 10-5 used previously and representing
two possible end-member floor deformations.

For  = 10-2 , the elastic term is dominant over the gravity current term
as the flow arrives to the wall zone and the effect of the local increase in
flexural wavelength of the overlying layer is to increase the thickening rate
with time (Figure 5.8 a). The increase in flexural wavelength enhances the
barrier effect of the lithostatic pressure increase at the crater wall zone and, in
response, the flow thickens rapidly in the center, where the bending is easier
(Figure 5.8 a and c). The elastic pressure increases with the bending and after
a time that increases with , it becomes important enough to compensate for
the lithostatic pressure increase at the wall zone and induce a squeezing of
the intrusion below the wall zone. For large values of , the local increase
in flexural wavelength is important at the wall zone and forces the flow to

extend and deform the overlying layer over a much larger distance, beyond

5.8 a). As a result, for large values of , the intrusion profile relaxes, the

5.4. Results

141

thickness at the center collapses (Figure 5.8 a and c) and the radius increases
quickly. After the relaxation of the profile, the intrusion is still in an elastic
regime but characterized by a flexural parameter b . Once the dimensionless
radius reaches r = 4b /C = 4(1 + )3/4 /C = 41/4 (1 + )3/4 , the intrusion
transitions to a gravity current regime where the thickness evolves toward a
constant and the radius grows as t1/2 (Figure 5.8 a). For instance, for  = 3,
the transition to a gravity current regime occurs when R = 41/4 (1 + )3/4 =
3.6 (Figure 5.8 a).
For  = 10-5 , the gravity current term is dominant when the intrusion
reaches the wall zone and the elastic term only controls the shape of the front
(Figure 5.8 b and d). And hence, the thickening rate only increases by a few
percent between  = 0.3 and  = 6, while it increases by a factor of 3 in
the case of  = 10-2 (Figure 5.8 a and b). Nevertheless, the local increase in
the flexural wavelength below the wall zone tends to enlarge the size of the
intrusion edge and to result in a deeper circular moat at the surface (Figure
5.8 d and f).

5.4.4

Spreading beneath a simple crater

In comparison to complex craters, the lithostatic pressure as well as the flexural wavelength of the upper layer gradually increase from the center to the
exterior of the crater wall zone. Given the appropriate range of values for the
number  = 10-3 - 10, as discussed in Section 5.3.4, the flexural parameter is
between 0.2 and 1 times the crater radius C. The bending of the upper layer
thus controls the intrusion shape and dynamics during the whole flow and the
intrusion always shows a bell shaped geometry (Figure 5.9). To represent the
case of an intrusion below a bowl-shaped crater, we use  = 0.25,  = 20,
 = 0.1 and we study the effect of the thickening at the wall zone by using
different values of  = 0.1 and  = 4.
For  = 0.1, the thickening at the wall zone (r) is negligible and the
elastic term is similar to that of a constant thickness layer. However, the
lithostatic pressure increase slows down the spreading and the evolution of
the radius with time is slower than for an elastic regime below a constant
thickness layer. The intrusion shows a bell-shaped profile with an important
curvature because the weight of the lithostatic barrier constrains the intrusion
edge (Figure 5.9 a). For  = 4, the local flexural wavelength rapidly rises up
to b = (1 + )3/4 . As a consequence, the intrusion squeezes more rapidly
and thickens more slowly than for smaller values of  (Figure 5.9 b). For a
larger value of , the deformation occurs over a larger wavelength and the
shallowing is smaller at a given time. However, the overall deformation at
the surface is very similar in both cases: the crater floor appears convex and

5.4.5

Effect of a variable injection rate

So far, we have assumed a constant injection rate; and hence the intrusion
grows indefinitely in volume and the flow passes the crater wall zone. However,
the driving pressure in the feeder conduit should decrease as the intrusion
grows during the thickening phase. In particular, the increase in hydrostatic
pressure due to magma weight and in elastic pressure due to bending above the
dyke might finally compensate for the initial overpressure P in the magma at
the origin of the flow. As the increase in lithostatic pressure at the crater wall
zone prevents the intrusion from spreading laterally, the intrusion might reach
a steady state profile such that no more magma can intrude. New expressions
for the vertical injection velocity and injection rate, taking into account the
increase in pressure in the magma at the top of the feeder dyke, are given by:

The dimensionless number  represents the normalized pressure head, Pe,r=0
is the dimensionless elastic pressure at the center and Q0 the dimensionless
total injection rate. As discussed in Michaut (2011), the elastic pressure Pe,r=0
required to bend the upper layer tends to infinity as R  0, but rapidly
decreases with the radius as Pe,r=0 scales with h0 /R4 (see (5.8)). However,
here we assume a large aspect ratio for the intrusion (lubrication assumption),
and this initial transient regime, where the flow is very narrow and Pe,r=0 is
very large, is thus not representative of the initiation phase of the intrusion.
Hence, to investigate the effect of the elastic pressure on the injection rate,
we neglect this initial transient phase.
Given that the deformations are limited to craters, it is possible that excavation of material during the impact has controlled the intrusion of magma.
In that case, the driving pressure P at the origin of the flow should be
lower or equal to the weight of crust that has been removed by cratering, i.e.

range of values for the parameters (Table 5.2), the value of the number

10-2 and 10-5 , to consider the effect of a variable injection rate.

below the crater flat floor; as Pe,r=0 scales with h0 /R4 , Pe,r=0 decreases as the
flow spreads and its radius increases (Figure 5.10 a) inducing an increase in
the total injection rate Q0 (5.32). Then, as the intrusion thickens, both the
pressure due to magma weight and the elastic pressure increases at the center,

in response (Figure 5.10 a). The total injection rate decreases and the system
reaches a steady state shape when Q0  0, i.e when the initial overpressure
is compensated by the sum of the elastic pressure and of the pressure due to
magma weight (Figure 5.10 a,b).
For  = 10-5 , the weight of the magma is the dominant contribution
to the pressure during the whole flow (Pm and Ptot are not distinguishable
on Figure 5.10 c) and the injection rate remains close to a constant while
the intrusion spreads below the crater flat floor in a gravity current regime
(Figure 5.10 c). As the intrusion thickens, the weight of magma increases
at the center (Figure 5.10 c) leading to a decrease in the total injection rate
(5.32). When, h0 =  = 22, no more magma intrudes below the crater, the
intrusion thickness as well as the radius stabilized and the intrusion reaches
its steady state shape (Figure 5.10 c, d).
The normalized pressure head thus controls the amount of shallowing of
the crater floor. If the pressure head is larger than the weight of the crust that
has been removed by cratering, the intrusion would pass the wall zone and
reach a constant thickness, but it would still continue to flow laterally beyond
the wall zone (see lateral spreading regime in Michaut (2011)). In contrast, if
the pressure head is less than the weight of the crust that has been removed
by cratering, the intrusion reaches a steady-state shape and deformations are
constrained within the crater. In that case, for small values of , the amount
of shallowing is directly the normalized pressure head  while for relatively
large values of , the intrusion reaches a steady state profile for a thickness
h0  .

Discussion
Floor appearance

Viscous relaxation tends to relax large wavelength structures without affecting
or creating small-scale features. In particular, viscous relaxation is not able to
explain the presence of moats bordering the wall region observed in different
classes of FFCs (Schultz , 1976a; Jozwiak et al., 2012). Relaxation of the crater
floor also tends to produce a convex profile at the end of the deformation
(Dombard and Gillis, 2001) and cannot account for central flat floors observed
for FFCs of class 3 and 5 (Jozwiak et al., 2012).
In contrast, our model is able to reproduce the different kinds of floor
appearances observed at FFCs and thus confirms the predictions initially made
by Schultz (1976a). In particular, for a given crater size, the thickening caused
by the increase in lithostatic pressure at the crater wall zone induces either a

146

Chapter 5. Floor-fractured craters

convex uplift of the crater floor, if the intrusion occurs below a thick elastic
layer, or a piston-like uplift of the crater floor if the intrusion occurs below
a strengthless and highly brecciated zone or below a thin elastic layer. This
piston-like uplift results in a large, shallowed plate like floor as predicted by
Schultz (1976a).
In addition, the model shows that the final appearance of the crater floor is
controlled by the ratio between the flexural wavelength of the overlying layer,
that mainly depends on the elastic layer thickness, and the crater size, i.e. on
the number  = (/C)4 . Indeed, because the deformation of the overlying
elastic layer is accommodated along a width of 4, our model predicts a
transition between a flat floor and a convex floor when 4  C, i.e. at
 = 10-3 . For large values of  > 10-3 , i.e. small craters and/or a thick
elastic layer overlying the intrusion, the bending of the upper elastic layer
affects the whole crater width resulting in a convex crater floor (Figure 5.7
a). On the contrary, for large craters and/or a thin elastic layer overlying
the intrusion, i.e. small values of  < 10-3 , the thickening of the flat top
intrusion results in a flat central floor with a circular moat that borders the
interior of the wall zone (Figure 5.7 b). This circular moat results from the
elastic deformation of the overlying layer at the intrusion front and its size
is equal to 4. Finally, if the overlying layer is strengthless and  = 0, the
crater floor appears flat or slightly concave up because of the density difference
between the magma and the overlying layer.
FFCs of classes 3 and 5 show a central uplifted flat floor; they generally
have a large diameter: the mean diameter is of 50 km for craters of class 3,
and 70 km for craters of class 5 (Table 5.1) (Schultz , 1976a; Jozwiak et al.,
2012). These large diameters are coherent with a small value of  (5.24), i.e.
with an intrusion in the gravity current regime as it reaches the wall zone and
a piston-like uplift of the central flat floor of the crater. A moat bordering
the wall region is observed for craters of class 3 in agreement with our results
for small values of  (see for instance the topography of FFC Warner Figure
5.1 b). Craters of class 5 have a central shallowed flat floor but do not show
a moat bordering the wall region (Table 5.1). One possibility is that the
intrusion has emplaced below a strengthless layer. Another possibility is that
these craters have been partially infilled before deformation by basin ejecta
(Schultz , 1976a); as a result, the thickening of the intrusion was limited and
not important enough to form a moat. Furthermore, for large craters and/or
intrusions below a thin elastic layer, our model predicts that the maximum
stresses are concentrated upon the intrusion edge within a crown bordering
the wall region (Figure D.1 c). This stress concentration in front of the crater
wall could induce new fractures or reactivate preliminary fractures caused by
the impact, providing privileged paths for the magma to rise to the surface

5.5. Discussion

147

(Schultz , 1976a). Indeed, pyroclastic deposits have been observed in floorfractured craters of classes 3 and 5, preferentially located within fractures
adjacent to the wall zone (Schultz , 1976a).
Convex floors characterize FFCs of classes 2 and 4 (see for instance FFC
Briggs, Figure 5.1 a). Craters of classes 2 and 4 are in fact generally small;
their average diameters are 30 and 20 km respectively (Jozwiak et al., 2012)
with some of them being initially simple craters (Table 5.1); this is coherent
with large values of  and a final convex floor appearance according to our
model. In FFCs of class 4, a more or less pronounced narrow V-shaped moat
is observed adjacent to the wall zone as well as pronounced inner ridges for
FFCs of class 4 b. In the frame of our model, we can interpret these features
as resulting from the rupture of the upper layer during the thickening regime.
Indeed, our model predicts that the radial stress might not be maximum at the
crater center, even for a convex floor, but at a given radial coordinate rmax
such that 0 < rmax < 1 (see Appendix D.1, Figure D.1 a, b) because the
intrusion might transition from an elastic to a gravity current shape before
the wall zone and because the elastic thickness increases towards the wall
zone. The location of rmax depends on time and on the values of  and .
This location of maximum stress provides a preferred location for a concentric
failure of the upper elastic layer.
Furthermore, our model can also explain the variable characteristics of
central peaks of FFCs (Schultz , 1976a). In the case where an elastic layer is
present, our model predicts that the central peak would be leveled up during
the uplift and slightly smaller than initially (see Appendix D.2, Figure D.2
b,c). Schultz (1976a) indeed observed that there is a tendency for central
peaks of FFCs to be smaller than those for well-preserved impact craters.
Furthermore, a small circular moat borders the central peak if this elastic
layer is relatively thin, such 4 < C (see Appendix D.2, Figure D.2 b). The
build up of stress resulting from the flexure within this moat could be coherent
with the fracture pattern observed in the vicinity of central peaks at some
FFCs (Schultz , 1976a). Finally, if the layer overlying the intrusion is formed
by incoherent breccias, the central peak would be buried during the uplift, or
its initial size significantly reduced if the shallowing is smaller than the central
peak height, and could thus be absent from the uplifted floor, as observed in
a few cases (Schultz , 1976a) (see Appendix D.2, Figure D.2 a).

5.5.2

Depth of the intrusion

The deformation of a layer overlying a shallow magmatic intrusion such as a
laccolith has been classically modeled by the upward deflection of a thin elastic
layer submitted to the pressure Pd within the intrusion (5.29). In this kind of

148

Chapter 5. Floor-fractured craters

static model, the internal pressure Pd within the intrusion is usually assumed
to be a constant and equal to the hydrostatic pressure due to the weight of
the magma at the center of the intrusion. The solution to this problem gives a
floor deflection, or maximum intrusion thickness h0 , that varies with radius to
the fourth (5.29) (Johnson and Pollard , 1973; Pollard and Johnson, 1973). In
the case of an intrusion below the floor of a crater, the crater radius clamps the
elastic overlying layer and the intrusion radius can be considered equal to the
crater radius, if the deformation affects the whole crater floor. And hence,
this approach has motivated many previous studies to derive the intrusion
depth from the estimated uplift at a given floor-fractured crater (Wichman
and Schultz , 1996; Jozwiak et al., 2012).
However, there is an inconsistency in equating the pressure due to magma
weight and the elastic pressure deforming the overlying plate since both pressures act in favor of flow spreading. Assuming that the final steady-state
shape of the flow has been reached, i.e. that the intrusion has reached the
wall zone and that the pressure above the feeding conduit is equal to the initial
overpressure driving the flow in the conduit (see Section 4.4), and assuming
that the overlying elastic layer making the crater floor has a constant thickness up to the wall zone, the function (5.29) may indeed describe the vertical
displacement of the overlying layer due to an elastic pressure Pe . But this is
true only in the case where the intrusion is in the elastic regime, i.e. if the
elastic pressure is dominant over the pressure due to magma weight and in this
case, the pressure necessary for deforming the overlying plate Pe is then not
supported by magma weight but by the driving pressure within the feeding
dyke (see (Michaut, 2011), Section 6.1). Furthermore, if the thickening at the
wall zone is significant, the curvature of the intrusion is accentuated by the
interaction with the wall zone and (5.29) is not accurate anymore. Moreover,
for large craters or shallow intrusions, i.e. 4 < C, the intrusion lies in the
gravity current regime when it reaches the crater wall zone. In that case, the
dominant pressure comes from magma weight and, assuming the intrusion has
reached the wall zone and its steady-state shape, then the overpressure driving the injection is compensated by magma weight and, Pd = m gh is a good
estimate of the pressure within the flow. However in this case, the intrusion
is characterized by a flat top and its profile is very different from (5.29) (see
Section 4.2.2) (Bunger and Cruden, 2011; Michaut, 2011) and hence, (5.29)
is no longer accurate to derive the intrusion depth.
Finally, using (5.29) and equating Pd = m gh0 to derive the intrusion depth
Te0 at FFCs leads to an intrusion depth that scales with the crater diameter
to the power four third, i.e. the larger the crater, the deeper the intrusion.
But, there is no reason to suppose that the intrusion depth scales with the
crater size.

5.5. Discussion

149

In contrast, the model we develop provides a simple method to estimate
the elastic thickness of the layer overlying the intrusion from the floor appearance. As discussed above, the floor of a crater appears convex if the flexural
wavelength of the layer overlying the intrusion is such that 4  C. As 
mainly depends on Te0 , and assuming the intrusion has reached the crater wall
zone, this inequality provides for a lower bound on the elastic thickness of the
upper layer:
Te0

44 E

1/3
(5.35)

For instance, Briggs is a class 2 FFC of 37 km in diameter, it shows a large
convex floor (Figure 5.1 a). Hence (5.35) applies and we estimate that the
intrusion lies beneath an elastic layer whose thickness is equal to or deeper
than 1.6 km for this specific crater, using parameter values listed in Table
(5.2). This value is only a minimum value for the intrusion depth, as it does
not take into account the potential presence of a brecciated layer on top or
below the elastic layer.
In the case of a crater showing a flat floor with a circular moat, the intrusion should be in a gravity current regime, and, assuming it has reached
the wall zone (which is likely to be the case if the shallowing is significant),
then the width of the moat directly provides for an estimate of the flexural
wavelength of the overlying elastic layer, and hence for the elastic thickness.
Indeed, the size of the moats corresponds to the width of the intrusion edge,
i.e. to 4 (see Figure 5.5 d, Figure 5.7 b and Section 5.4.2). For instance, for
the class 3 FFC Warner, which is 35 km in diameter, the deformation shows a
plate-like central flat floor, with a moat bordering the wall region of about one
third of the crater radius (Figure 5.1 b). Hence, (4)/C  1/3 and the elastic
thickness Te0 varies between 300 and 600 m.Again, this estimate provides a
minimum value for the intrusion depth.

5.5.3

Injection rate and formation time scale

Precedent works have shown that, for craters smaller than 100 km in diameter,
the shallowing associated with viscous relaxation is small or almost inexistent
(Dombard and Gillis, 2001). In contrast, our model of magmatic intrusion
is able to reproduce the large discrepancy in crater floor shallowing observed
at FFCs. Two mechanisms might control the final amount of shallowing: the
injection rate and the cooling of the intrusion.
If the cooling time scale of the intrusion is large compared to its formation
time scale, then the intrusion reaches the wall zone and thickens. In that
case, assuming a constant injection rate, the maximum amount of shallowing

150

Chapter 5. Floor-fractured craters

corresponds to the intrusion thickness that evolves toward a dimensionless
thickness of  + Hg . However, as explained in Section 5.4.5, the injection rate
should decrease as the intrusion grows, in particular during the thickening
phase. Indeed, when the magma reaches the wall zone, the pressure due to
magma weight and to elastic deformation of the overlying layer increases as
the crater floor is uplifted and might finally compensate for the initial pressure
driving the flow in the melt source. An estimate of this initial overpressure can
be derived from our model in some cases. Indeed, for small values of , i.e.
for craters that show a flat floor like those of classes 3 and 5, the overpressure
in the melt source might be estimated from the final thickness of the intrusion
at the center hf0 , i.e. P = m ghf0 as proposed by Jozwiak et al. (2012)
(Figure 5.10 c, d). However, for large values of , i.e. for craters that show a
convex floor, as craters of classes 2 and 4, this assumption is inappropriate as
both the pressure due to magma weight and the elastic pressure contribute to
compensate for the initial overpressure P , i.e. P > m ghf0 (Figure 5.10 a
and b).
For most FFCs, the deformation is contained within the crater floor
(Schultz , 1976a) suggesting that the removal of material during the impact
controlled the initial overpressure in the melt source. However, impact craters
commonly show a raised rim, which is uplifted relative to the pre-impact surface and this structure could also contribute to prevent the intrusion from
growing beyond the wall zone. Finally, in a few cases such as crater Haldane
(Schultz , 1976a), the deformations extend well beyond the wall zone and suggest that the intrusion passed the wall zone, i.e. that the initial overpressure
might have been larger than c gDc + Pr where Pr is the lithostatic pressure
excess induced by the raised rim.
The deep floor of Class 1 FFCs suggests that these craters didn't undergo
the thickening phase (Table 5.1). However, the network of fractures on their
floor is coherent with the spreading of an underlying intrusion that might be
an aborted sill that cooled before reaching the wall zone. In that case, the
time scale for the intrusion to reach the wall zone  = (C 2 H)/Q0 is larger
than the time scale for cooling of the intrusion. The time scale for cooling
can be estimated from the characteristic time for conductive cooling of an
intrusion of average thickness h
c =

h2


(5.36)

where  = 10-6 m2 .s-1 is the thermal diffusivity of basalt. For large craters of
class 1, the intrusion is more likely to be in a gravity current regime with an
average thickness close to h  2H. The inequality c   ((5.15) and (5.36))
provides for an upper bound for the average injection rate:

5.6. Conclusion

Q0  408(C 8 4 m g) 5

(5.37)

For instance, for the crater Atlas, which is 87 km in diameter and is located
at 46.7N, 44.4E in the southeast of Mare Frigoris, the injection rate should
be smaller than 10-2 m3 .s-1 , using parameter values listed in Table (5.2).
This value is for instance in agreement with the extrusion rate of lavas on the
Moon estimated at the end of the Imbrian and during the Eratosthenian period
by Head and Wilson (1992). However, most of the FFCs have undergone a
thickening stage and hence are such that c   , and this inequality provides
for a lower bound for the average injection rate for these craters.

5.6

Conclusion

The model shows that the spreading of an intrusion at depth below a crater
is able to reproduce the deformations observed at FFCs and thus confirms
the different predictions made by Schultz (1976a). In particular, the increase
in lithostatic pressure and in flexural wavelength of the overlying layer at the
crater wall zone prevent the intrusion from spreading radially and induce a
thickening of the intrusion that leads to the shallowing of the crater floor.
When the time scale for conductive cooling of the intrusion is large compared
to the formation time scale, the amount of shallowing is controlled by the
initial overpressure in the melt source. The model predicts that the final appearance of the crater floor, including the presence/disappearance of a central
peak, is mainly controlled by the upper layer flexural wavelength , i.e. its
structure and thickness, and the crater radius C.
For an overlying layer with no elastic strength, i.e. an intrusion emplaced
within or immediately beneath a brecciated lens, the crater floor is flat at the
end of the deformation. If an elastic layer lies on top of the intrusion, but is
sufficiently thin such that C  4, the crater shows a central plate-like floor
separated from the wall zone by a circular moat. This moat results from the
deformation of the thin elastic overlying layer above the intrusion front and
its width is equal to 4. The depth of the moat is controlled by the amount
of thickening of the overlying layer at the crater wall zone. Finally, if the
intrusion is emplaced beneath a thick elastic layer such that C < 4, the
crater shows a convex floor.
Within the framework of this model, FFCs of class 1 would result from
aborted sills that have cooled before reaching the wall zone. Craters showing a
convex floor, such as those of classes 2 and 4, would result from the spreading
of an intrusion below a relatively thick elastic layer, such that   C/4.
On the contrary, craters showing a flat floor, such as those of classes 3 and

152

Chapter 5. Floor-fractured craters

5, would result from the spreading of an intrusion beneath a relatively thin
elastic layer, such that  << C/4. The wide circular U-shaped moat of class
3 FFCs is well explained by the elastic deformation of the thin elastic layer
overlying the intrusion while the V-shaped moat of class 4 FFCs, showing a
convex floor, could be explained by the rupture of the overlying layer, which is
predicted to occur at a radial coordinate intermediate between the center and
the wall zone. The absence of a moat for craters of class 5 could suggest that
the intrusion develops immediately beneath or within a breccia lens and that
not sufficiently impact melt stands above the breccia to form an elastic layer.
Finally, class 6 FFCs are filled up by lavas that have reached the surface.
In addition, the model allows to constrain the elastic thickness of the layer
lying on top of the intrusion, which provides a lower bound for the intrusion
depth.

Lunar floor-fractured craters are impact craters characterized by distinctive shallow floors crossed by important networks of fractures. Different scenarios have been proposed to explain their formations but recent studies
showed that the intrusion of magma at depth below the crater floor is the
most plausible explanation. The intrusion of dense magma within the light
upper-most part of the lunar crust should have left a positive signature in
the gravity field. This study takes advantage of the unprecedented resolution of the lunar gravity field obtained from the NASA's Gravity Recovery
and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, in combination with topographic
data obtained from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) instrument,
to investigate the gravitational signatures of both normal and floor-fractured

154

Chapter 6. Gravitationnal signature of lunar floor-fractured
craters

craters. Despite the large variability in their gravitational signatures, the
floor-fractured and normal craters in the Highlands show significant differences: the gravitational anomalies are significantly larger at floor-fractured
craters. The anomaly amplitudes for floor-fractured craters are in agreement
with synthetic gravity anomalies based on the predicted intrusion shapes from
a theoretical flow model. Our results are consistent with magmatic intrusions
intruding a crust characterized by a 12% porosity and where the intrusion
has no porosity. Similar studies have been carried out in the lunar maria
and South Pole Aikten basin. Although the average gravitational signature of
floor-fractured craters is larger than at normal craters in these regions, they
cannot be distinguished statistically due to the small number of craters and
the large variability of the anomalies. In general, a better characterization
of the signal due solely to the initial impact crater is needed to isolate the
magmatic intrusion signal and characterize the density contrast between the
magma and crust.

6.1

Introduction

There are a class of impact craters on the Moon that are distinguished by having uplifted floors and radially/concentric floor-fractured networks. About 200
of these floor-fractured craters (FFCs) have been identified by Schultz (1976a)
and these impact craters are interpreted to have undergone endogenous deformations after their formation. The most striking feature of these craters
is their shallow floors compared to normal craters of the same size, with the
uplift reaching 50% of the initial crater depth in some cases (Schultz , 1976a).
Due to this deformation, their floors show large networks of radial, concentric
and pentagonal fractures. Additionally, depending on local conditions, the
uplift results in either a convex floor or a flat plate-like floor, sometimes with
a wide circular moat just interior to the rim (Schultz , 1976a; Jozwiak et al.,
2012).
Intrusion of magma beneath the crater floor and viscous relaxation of the
crater topography after the impact are two proposed scenarios to explain these
deformations (Schultz , 1976a; Hall et al., 1981; Wichman and Schultz , 1995a;
Dombard and Gillis, 2001). The recent theoretical model for the dynamics of
crater-centered intrusions of Thorey and Michaut (2014) and recent morphological and geological studies by Jozwiak et al. (2012) showed that intrusion
of magma beneath the crater floor is the most plausible scenario to produce
the morphological features observed at floor-fractured craters.
Magmatic intrusions should be emplaced at their level of neutral buoyancy (Walker , 1989; Taisne and Tait, 2009; Wichman and Schultz , 1995a).

6.2. Theoretical considerations

155

Upon cooling and solidification, however, their densities will be larger than
the surrounding crustal material and hence, leave a positive signature in the
gravity field. Schultz (1976a) looked at the gravitational signature of some
floor-fractured craters with gravity derived from radio tracking data acquired
during the Apollo 15 and 16 missions (Sjogren et al., 1972, 1974). Except at
the floor-fractured crater Taruntius, where a strong gravity anomaly was detected, no pronounced gravity anomalies were observed at other floor-fractured
crater sites. However, the gravity data from these two experiments only covered a narrow swath along the equator and the resolution of the data used
in these studies were not able to detect gravity anomalies for objects smaller
than about 100 km in diameter (Schultz , 1976a; Sjogren et al., 1974), which
includes about 88% of the floor-fractured crater population.
Data from the NASA Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL)
NASA mission have provided a global map of the Moon's gravity field with
an unprecedented resolution. These data have been used to construct a model
of the gravity field to spherical harmonic degree and order 900, which corresponds to a half-wavelength resolution of  6 km at the lunar surface (Zuber
et al., 2013; Konopliv et al., 2014). These data, used in combination with the
topographic data obtained from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA)
instrument allow to investigate mass anomalies located in the lunar crust. In
particular, these data allow to resolve small-scale density variations in the
shallow crust (Besserer et al., 2014; Wieczorek et al., 2013) and they have
been used to detect ancient igneous intrusions (Andrews-Hanna et al., 2013).
In this paper, after some theoretical considerations on the expected gravitational signal at floor-fractured craters in section 6.2, we use GRAIL gravity
to detect the presence of magmatic intrusions at floor-fractured crater sites in
section 6.3. Then, we develop a method to derive the density contrast between
the magma and crust in section 6.4. We discuss its geological implications in
section 6.5 and conclude in section IV.

6.2

Theoretical considerations

The Bouguer anomaly associated with a magmatic intrusion beneath a crater
depends upon the intrusion characteristics, namely its density and shape. Recently, we showed that the morphology of crater-centered intrusions depends
mainly upon the thickness of the overlying elastic layer and on the crater size
(Thorey and Michaut, 2014). Guided by the results and predictions of our
model that is briefly summarized below, we here calculate and discuss the
expected gravitational signal at floor-fractured crater sites.

Constitutive equations

In our model, the intrusion is fed at a constant rate through a cylindrical
conduit located below the center of a crater floor and spreads horizontally
along a thin bedding plane (Figure 6.1). The magma makes rooms for itself

is the dimensionless flexural wavelength of the upper layer raised to the power

relative to the crater radius. It varies between 10-5 and 10-1 and has a strong
influence on the intrusion shape and final floor appearance.

6.2.2

End-member modes of deformation

For a constant injection rate and no crater depression, i.e a constant upper
elastic layer ((r) = 0 and Te (r) = Te0 ), the numerical resolution of the equations shows two spreading regimes (Michaut, 2011; Michaut et al., 2013). The

6.2. Theoretical considerations

159

flow is first driven by the bending of the upper elastic layer. The intrusion is
bell-shaped and both the radius and the thickness evolve close to t1/3 . When
the radius becomes larger than 4, the weight of the intrusion becomes dominant over the bending terms and the intrusion enters a gravity current regime.
In this second regime, the intrusion shows a flat top with bent edges, the radius evolve as t1/2 and the thickness tends to a constant (Huppert, 1982a;
Michaut, 2011).
For a constant injection rate and a crater-like topography for the upper
layer, i.e. Te (r) given by (6.1), the spreading regimes are perturbed by the
presence of the crater wall. The central flat floor of the crater first acts as
a constant elastic upper layer and the intrusion spreads as described above.
However, when it reaches the crater wall, the important increase in lithostatic
pressure prevents the magma from spreading horizontally. The intrusion thickens in response and the crater floor is uplifted (Thorey and Michaut, 2014).
Accordingly, the intrusion thickness can be estimated from the amount of
uplift of the crater floor at the center.

number  (6.14). For a large value of , i.e. a deep intrusion and/or a small
crater, the intrusion reaches the wall in the bending regime. The intrusion is
bell-shaped and the uplift of the crater floor leads to a shallowed convex floor
(Figure 6.2, left). In contrast, for a small value of , i.e. a shallow intrusion
and/or a large crater, the intrusion is in a gravity current regime when it
reaches the crater wall. The thickening of the cylinder-like intrusion leads to
a piston-like uplift of the crater floor and to a shallowed central flat floor for
the crater (Figure 6.2, right).
Accordingly, this model results into two main types of floor-fractured
craters: craters with convex floors corresponding to bell-shaped intrusions
(Figure 6.2, left) and craters with plate-like floors corresponding to cylindershaped intrusions (Figure 6.2, right). In the following, we consider craters of
classes 2 and 4 of Schultz (1976a) to represent manifestations of bell-shaped
intrusions, and craters of classes 1, 3, 5 and 6 to be manifestations of cylindershaped intrusions.

6.2.3

Gravitational signature of FFCs: two case studies

The Bouguer gravity is the gravity anomaly that remains after taking into account the gravitational signature of surface topography. Thus, if there are no
lateral variations in crustal density, the Bouguer anomaly of a floor-fractured
crater should be entirely the result of the magmatic intrusion. The Bouguer
anomaly associated with a magmatic intrusion depends upon the intrusion
morphology, the intrusion depth and the density contrast  between the
intrusion and the surrounding crust.
We investigate the signal expected at floor-fractured craters as a function
of the intrusion shape, diameter and depth. In particular, for the bell and
cylinder shaped intrusion, we study the signal for an intrusion diameter that
varies between 20 and 180 km, i.e. the minimum and maximum diameter of
floor-fractured craters observed by Schultz (1976a) and two intrusion depths,
i.e. Te0 = 0 km and a reasonable upper bound of 5 km (Thorey and Michaut,
2014). We set the intrusion thickness H0 to a value of 2 km, which is the
maximum uplift observed by Schultz (1976a) and the density contrast between
the magma and the crust to a value of  = 600 kg m-3 , the maximum density
contrast between mafic and crustal lunar rocks using the bulk densities of
Kiefer et al. (2012).
The two end-member intrusion profiles are obtained by solving equation
(6.8) for two different values of the dimensionless number  (6.14),  = 10-2
for the bell-shaped intrusion and  = 10-5 for the cylinder-like intrusion
(Thorey and Michaut, 2014) . We stop the simulations when the uplift at
the center h0 is significant and such that the pressure due to the intrusion

6.2. Theoretical considerations

161

weight at the center is about half the lithostatic pressure due to the crater
wall (h0 = 10). Finally, each profile is redimensionalized: the axial coordinate
of the dimensionless thickness profile is multiplied by D/2 and the dimensionless thickness profile is multiplied by H0 /h0 , where h0 is the dimensionless
thickness of the intrusion at the end of the simulation.
We calculate the synthetic radial gravity anomaly (more precisely, the
gravity disturbance) gs corresponding to each intrusion profile using the spherical harmonics expansion

where r,  and  are the coordinates of observation, G is the gravitational
constant, M the mass of the Moon, Ri the reference radius of the spherical
harmonic coefficients taken as the mean radius at the site of intrusion, i.e.
Ri = R0 - Te0 + h where R0 is the mean lunar radius and h the mean intrusion
thickness, Clm , and Ylm the spherical harmonic functions of degree l and order
m (Wieczorek and Phillips, 1998). Gravitational accelerations are considered
positive when directed downward (see Appendix E for the expression of the
spherical harmonic coefficients associated with the intrusion thickness profile
and the calculation details).
The two different intrusion shapes result in two different types of anomaly
(Figure 6.3, left). For a bell-shaped intrusion, with a convex crater floor, the
gravity anomaly is also bell-shaped. It decreases gradually from the center to
the crater wall (Figure 6.3, top left). For an intrusion placed at the surface,
Te0 = 0, the signal barely depends on the crater diameter. The mean gravity
anomaly measured interior to the crater wall is almost constant and about 15
mGal (Figure 6.3, top right). Although an increased intrusion depth decreases
the mean value of the anomaly by a factor that is less than two for craters
smaller than 50 km, it barely affects the anomaly for craters larger than 50
km (Figure 6.3; top right).
For a cylinder-like intrusion and a plate-like crater floor, the gravity
anomaly is relatively uniform and sharply decreases at the crater wall (Figure 6.3, bottom left). Consequently, although the maximum amplitude of
the anomaly is similar to the one produced by a bell-shaped intrusion, the
mean gravity anomaly, measured interior to the crater wall, is twice larger
and about 30 mGal. Similar to bell-shaped intrusion, an increased intrusion
depth decreases the mean value of the anomaly by a factor that is less than
two for craters smaller than 50 km but barely affects the anomaly for craters
larger than 50 km (Figure 6.3, bottom right).
One important observation of our modeling is that even for an extreme case
of a 2 km thick and a 180 km diameter intrusion placed at the surface with a

large density contrast of 600 kg m-3 , the expected signal is only of a few tens of
mGal. Though GRAIL can easily detect such small amplitude anomalies, this
gravity signals could be masked by both large-scale regional signals and shortwavelength signals that are unrelated to our idealized model of Figure 6.1.
Therefore, we need to filter out these other contributions to be able to detect
the potential presence of magmatic intrusions at floor-fractured craters. In the
following, we present the gravity model that we use and consider the remaining
expected signal after filtering the synthetics the same way the observed gravity
are filtered.

Filtered GRAIL gravity

Power (m2)

The observed gravity field on the Moon is a result of several contributions,
including surface topography, relief along the crust-mantle interface and density heterogeneities in both the mantle and the crust. In order to detect the
presence of magmatic intrusions in the shallow crust, which have predicted
anomalies of only a few tens of mGal, we first remove all known signatures
from the observed gravity field in order to highlight those signals that remain.
To construct this model, we start with JGGRAIL 900C11A gravity field,
which is developed to spherical harmonic degree 900 and which is based on
all data obtained during the GRAIL primary and extended mission (Konopliv
et al., 2014). From the free-air gravity model, we first compute the Bouguer
anomaly by removing the gravitational contribution of surface topography
and the long-wavelength variations in crustal density that are predicted from
remote sensing data, as described in Wieczorek et al. (2013). The most prominent signals that remain are either associated with large impact basins or are
anticorrelated with long-wavelength topography. We interpret the majority
of this signal as being the result of crustal thickness variations, and use the
Bouguer anomaly to invert for the gravitational signal of relief along the crustmantle interface, as described in Wieczorek et al. (2013).

Chapter 6. Gravitationnal signature of lunar floor-fractured
craters

Since the shortest wavelength signals in the Bouguer anomaly are unlikely
to be the result of crustal thickness variations, and since short-wavelength signals become highly amplified when extrapolated with depth below the surface,
we apply the low-pass filter of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998) to the Bouguer
anomaly before inverting for crustal thickness variations. This filter is parameterized by having a value of 0.5 at spherical harmonic degree . The choice of
 is subjective, and  is chosen such that the obtained crustal thickness map
does not contain excessive power at the shortest wavelengths. In Wieczorek
et al. (2013),  was chosen to have a value of 80. Here, we test several values
for  and find that  = 80 is also a good trade-off between the removal of
regional trends and the removal of signals due to the magmatic intrusion itself
(see Appendix E Figure 1 for details on the effects of ).
After removing the gravitational signal of the crustal-mantle interface from
the Bouguer anomaly, the remainder of the signal is attributed to lateral variations in density within the crust of the Moon. To remove short wavelength
noise in the gravitational field, we also apply a cosine filter to the spherical
harmonic coefficients between degree 550 and 650. It is from this map, here referred to as CrustAnom, that we search for gravitational anomalies associated
with floor-fractured craters. Our model CrustAnom is roughly equivalent to
a band-passed Bouguer anomaly, where both the shortest and longest wavelength signals are removed (Figure 6.4).
Upon applying the same filtering to synthetic gravity anomalies, the expected signal at floor-fractured craters is reduced with respect to those considered in section (6.2.3) (Figure 6.5). The filtering, which affects mostly
large craters, leads to a drop in the amplitude of the gravity anomaly by a
factor larger than two for craters larger than about 80 km. As an example,
the mean anomaly for the extreme case of a 2 km thick and 180 km large
intrusion should only be of a few mGal in the model CrustAnom (Figure 6.5).

6.3

Gravitational signature of lunar craters

The gravitational signal associated with magmatic intrusions at floorfractured craters will be superimposed on the signal of a normal impact crater.
We use the model CrustAnom to first quantify the gravity signal at normal
impact craters and then compare to the signal at found floor-fractured craters.

Normal and floor-fractured crater populations

floor-fractured craters. We consider only complex craters and thus use a minimum crater diameter of 20 km, which is the transitional crater diameter
between simple and complex lunar craters (Pike, 1974, 1980). We use a maximum crater diameter of 180 km, because for larger craters, the mantle uplift
associated with basin formation becomes apparent in the gravity data (Melosh
et al., 2013). These criteria result in a population of 116 floor-fractured and
5101 normal craters covering the whole lunar surface.
The observed gravity field of an impact crater will depend upon the density
of the crust. GRAIL gravity data show that crustal density is not constant,
and that regional variations of  250 kg m-3 exist, primarily between the
highlands and the South Pole Aitken basin (SPA). In addition, surface den-

sities in the maria are considerably higher than in the highlands (Besserer
et al., 2014). To minimize potential biases that might arise from regional
variations in crustal density or geologic evolution, we divide each crater population (normal and floor-fractured craters) into three sub-populations. The
first is constituted by craters that lie within the highlands, outside of both
the maria and South Pole-Aitken basin. We use the USGS geological maps
to define the mare borders and the SPA basin is defined using the best-fit
outer ellipse of Garrick-Bethell and Zuber (2009). In the highlands, there are

6.3. Gravitational signature of lunar craters

167

80 floor-fractured and 4054 normal craters (Figure 6.6, top left). The second
sub-population is constituted by craters that lie within the maria and outside
of SPA basin of which there are 22 floor-fractured and 306 normal craters
(Figure 6.6, middle left). The last sub-population is constituted by craters
within the SPA of which there are 14 floor-fractured and 603 normal craters
(Figure 6.6, bottom left).
In each region defined above, the spatial distribution of floor-fractured
and normal craters is different (Figure 6.6, left). To minimize any biases
that might result from different regional characteristics, we also consider, for
each region, a second sub-population of normal craters that shares the same
spatial distribution as the floor-fractured craters (Figure 6.6, right). In this
sub-population, we consider all normal craters that are less than 150 km away
from a floor fractured crater.

6.3.2

Crater gravitational signatures

In analyzing the gravitational signature of lunar impact craters, we make use
of a single number, the crater gravity anomaly, that is defined as the average
gravitational anomaly with respect to the regional value. In calculating this
number, we first calculate the average gravitational anomaly from our model
CrustAnom within the main crater rim, i.e. within a circular region defined by
its radius D/2 where D is the crater diameter reported by Head et al. (2010)
and Jozwiak et al. (2012). We then subtract from this value the average value
of the gravity field in an annulus extending from the crater rim to a radius of
one crater diameter D (Appendix E, Figure 2). Both gravitational anomalies
are calculated at the average elevation of the crater.
6.3.2.1

Highlands

The magnitude of the gravity anomalies at normal crater sites shows an important variability (Figure 6.7). On average, the anomaly is positive at the
smallest craters, slowly decreases with increasing diameters, and approaches
a constant negative value near a diameter of about 100 km. For crater diameters between 100 and 180 km, the mean magnitude of the gravity anomalies
is independent of the diameter and close to -5 mGal. The mean of the gravity anomalies for the whole population g is negative and equal to -0.71
mGal. This number is well constrained due to the large number of craters.
In particular, the uncertainty in the mean (the standard error, which is the
standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of observations)
is equal to 0.12 mGal. The population that shares the spatial distribution
of floor-fractured craters shows similar trends (Figure 6.7). A Kolmogorov-

168

Chapter 6. Gravitationnal signature of lunar floor-fractured
craters

Smirnov (KS) test was conducted to compare this population to the whole
population of normal craters. The test reports a value of p, which is the probability that the two population are drawn from the same distribution, larger
than 10%, which confirms that no significant differences exist between the two
populations (Appendix E, Table 1).

Figure 6.7: Magnitude of the gravity anomaly g versus diameter D for the
normal crater population (blue dots), the normal crater population that shares
the FFC spatial distribution (light blue dots) and the floor-fractured crater
population (red triangles) in the highlands. Solid line: Mean of the gravity anomalies binned in 15 km diameter intervals. Error bars correspond to
the standard error for each bin. Right plot: Corresponding gravity anomaly
density distribution for each population in frequency (%).

The magnitude of the gravity anomalies at floor-fractured craters shows
a different dependence with diameter than at normal craters (Figure 6.7).
Although the variance of the data with respect to the average is of the same
order, the gravity anomalies at floor-fractured craters are larger. In particular,
the mean of the floor-fractured crater gravity anomalies is positive and approximately 2.7 mGal larger than the mean of the normal crater gravity anomalies.
We made use of a t-test to determine the robustness of the difference between
the mean magnitude of the gravity anomalies of the two populations. This
test quantifies the significance of a difference between the means of two populations assuming the two populations have the same variance. We found that
there was only less than a 5% chance that the difference in the mean of the
two populations could have occurred by chance (Appendix E, Table 1). The
same result holds for the comparison with the normal crater population that

6.4. Magmatic intrusion characteristics

169

shares the spatial distribution of floor-fractured craters (Appendix E, Table
1).
6.3.2.2

Lunar maria and SPA

The magnitude of the gravity anomalies at the sites of complex craters in
the lunar maria shows a variability that is similar to craters in the highlands
(Figure 6.8, top). The gravity anomaly remains close to 0 mGal and is independent of the crater diameter (Figure 6.8, top). The mean of the whole
population g is positive and equal to 1.51  0.68 mGal. A KS test shows
that there is no significant difference between the entire normal crater population and the one that shares the spatial distribution of floor-fractured craters
(Figure 6.8, top, Appendix E, Table 1).
The normal craters in the South Pole Aikten basin show gravity anomalies
that are somewhat more negative than in the highlands (Figure 6.8, bottom).
On average, the signal decreases with increasing diameter up to D  100-120
km (Figure 6.8, bottom) and increases somewhat again for crater diameters
between 120 and 180 km (Figure 6.8, bottom). A KS test shows that there is
no significant difference between the two populations of normal craters (Figure
6.8, bottom, Appendix E, Table 1).
Although the mean magnitude of the gravity anomalies at FFC sites is
about 3 mGal larger than the mean value observed at normal craters in the
maria and SPA, the variability in the signal is large and there is no significant
statistical difference between the mean of the gravity anomalies of normal and
floor-fractured craters in those two different regions. Indeed, a t-test, realized
for both regions, shows that there was more than a 10% chance that these
differences in the mean of the two populations could have occurred by chance
(Appendix E, Table 1). Nevertheless, the small number of FFCs in the maria
and in the SPA makes difficult to obtain a significant statistic due to the low
accuracy in measuring the FFC population mean (g = 4.43  3.52 mGal in
the maria and g = -0.25  2.52 mGal in SPA).

Magmatic intrusion characteristics

Our results show that, on average, crustal gravity anomalies at floor-fractured
craters are larger than at normal craters, but also that this result is statistically significant only for the highlands. This is in agreement with the presence of dense magmatic intrusions at depth below floor-fractured crater floors.
In addition, the amplitudes of the gravitational signatures at floor-fractured
craters are only of a few mGal, comparable to the predictions based on the

to a synthetic gravity anomaly constructed based on the theoretical model of
Thorey and Michaut (2014) in order to derive the mean density contrast be-

6.4. Magmatic intrusion characteristics

tween the intrusion and the surrounding crust. To that purpose, the thickness
of each intrusion is needed and we use LOLA topographic data to estimate
this quantity for each floor-fractured crater.

6.4.1

Intrusion thickness

The intrusion thickness H0 at the center of the crater is taken as the amount
of shallowing of the crater floor with respect to the expected depth (Schultz ,
1976a; Jozwiak et al., 2012). Given the observed crater depth, the problem
is to estimate the original crater depth before the intrusion formed. In the
study of Jozwiak et al. (2012), the scaling law which gives the depth dc as
a function of the crater diameter D, derived by Pike (1974), was used as an
estimate for the initial crater depth. However, this scaling law was calculated
using only recent, Erastosthenian, and well preserved craters, and it is generally acknowledged that floor-fractured craters are generally older and more
degraded than this population. In the absence of information on the state of
degradation of lunar craters in the dataset of Head et al. (2010), we thus use
the characteristics of the normal craters that share the spatial distribution of
floor-fractured craters described in section 6.3.1 as a reference.
We characterize the depths of both normal and floor-fractured craters using
the 64 ppd ( 450 m/pixel) LOLA gridded topography data (Zuber et al.,
2009) obtained from the planetary data system geosciences node. We followed
the method described by Kalynn et al. (2013) to derive the crater depth dc
and its uncertainty d (see Appendix E for details). Our dc -D results for
normal craters show trends that are consistent with previous works in the
highlands, the lunar maria and the SPA (Figure 6.9). Indeed, the crater
depth of normal craters increases with increasing diameter and craters in the
maria are on average shallower than in the highlands or SPA (Figure 6.9)
(Pike, 1974, 1980; Kalynn et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the variability in the
degradation state of each crater results in an important variance in the crater
depth with diameter with respect to the mean trend.
The same variability holds for the floor-fractured crater population depth
(Figure 6.9). This variability makes the identification of the uplift difficult
at floor-fractured craters. Although the mean crater depth of floor-fractured
craters in the highlands and SPA is slightly smaller than the mean of the normal crater population, the means of the two populations are not significantly
different in the three regions (t-test: p > 0.5, Appendix E, Table 2). A detailed geological study at each crater would be necessary to precisely identify
the crater morphological structures and decrease the uncertainty in the depth
estimation, but such a study is out of the scope of this article. We decided
to estimate the intrusion thickness at floor-fractured craters only to a first

order by considering the difference in the mean trends between normal and
floor-fractured craters.
To characterize the mean trend of normal craters, we make use of a linear
least-squares regression in log-log space to obtain a power law relationship
of the form dc = ADB (Pike, 1974; Kalynn et al., 2013). We use the same
method to characterize the mean dependence of floor-fractured crater depth
with crater diameter. In addition of determining the constant A and B,
we also calculated the root-mean-squared dispersion fit around the best fit
(Appendix E, Table 2). Subtracting the two best fit lines, we finally obtain
a first-order estimate for the intrusion thickness at the center H0 for each
floor-fractured crater of given diameter D to which we assign an error H0 =

Density contrast  of the intrusion

We consider two different shapes for the intrusions beneath floor-fractured
craters: a bell-shaped intrusion for craters that show a convex floor (class 2
and 4 in the classification of Schultz (1976a)) and a cylindrical-shaped intrusion for craters that show a plate-like floor (class 1, 3, 5 and 6 in the classification of Schultz (1976a)). The two dimensionless profiles are described
in section 6.2.2 and each profile is redimensionalized using the thickness of
the intrusion H0 and its radius D/2 (see section 6.4.1). The method used to
derive the synthetic gravity anomaly from the intrusion thickness profile is
detailed is section 6.2.3. We use a unit density contrast, i.e.  = 1 kg m-3
and then filter the predicted gravity anomaly in exactly the same way than
the observed gravity is filtered (section 6.2.4). The synthetic gravity anomaly
gs associated with each floor-fractured crater is defined as the mean of the
synthetic gravity anomaly measured interior to the crater rim.
Finally, the density contrast between the magma and the crust at a specific
floor-fractured crater location is given by the difference of the observed gravity
anomaly gobs and the value of the gravity anomaly for normal craters gc of the
same diameter, divided by the synthetic gravity anomaly for a unit density
contrast gs
gobs - gc
 =
gs

(6.16)

where  is in kg m-3 .
We find that the corrected gravity anomalies observed at floor-fractured
crater sites in the highlands are consistent with a mean density contrast between the magma and the crust of  = 913  269 kg m-3 (Appendix E,
Table 4). In the maria, the corrected gravity anomalies observed in the 22
floor-fractured craters are consistent with a mean density contrast equal to
 = 484  669 kg m-3 (Appendix E, Table 4). However, the difference
between the mean density contrast in the highlands and the maria is not significant (a t-test gives a probability greater than 10% that this could occur
by chance, p > 0.1). In the South Pole Aikten basin, the corrected gravity anomalies observed in the 14 floor-fractured craters are consistent with a
mean density contrast equal to  = 974  846 kg m-3 (Appendix E, Table
4). But, the difference between the mean density contrast in the highlands
and SPA is also not significant (a t test gives a probability greater than 50%
that this could occur by chance, p > 0.5).

Discussion

In this study, we used the gravity field obtained by the GRAIL mission, in
combination with the topographic data obtained by the LOLA instrument, to
resolve mass anomalies below floor-fractured craters. We studied separately
the craters in the farside highlands, South Pole-Aikten basin and maria to
prevent potential bias from regional effects.
We show that the average gravitational signature of normal craters in the
highlands is negative, whereas the average gravitational signature of floorfractured craters is positive. Although a large variability characterizes the
magnitude of gravity anomalies in both populations, the difference between
the mean of the two populations, equal to  3 mGal, is statistically significant. In addition, the floor-fractured crater gravity anomalies do not follow
the same dependence with diameter as normal craters. Our results are consistent with the emplacement of magmatic intrusions below floor-fractured
craters as originally proposed by Schultz (1976a). Furthermore, the observed
gravity anomalies (after filtering) of a few mGal are in agreement with the
values expected from the model of crater-centered intrusion of Thorey and
Michaut (2014). In particular, measured gravity anomalies at floor-fractured
craters imply an average density contrast between the magma and the surrounding crust equal to  = 913  269 kg m-3 . Thermal annealing could
also participate to the measured gravity anomaly, which would then decrease
the estimated density contrast, though this effect should be limited to a few
percents (Michaut and Jaupart, 2011; Kiefer , 2013).
The grain density of lunar basalt can vary from 3270 kg m-3 for low Ti
basalt to 3450 kg m-3 for high Ti basalt (Kiefer et al., 2012). In contrast,
the lunar crust, which is mainly anorthositic, shows grain densities that vary
from 2800 kg m-3 to 2900 kg m-3 . The grain density contrast between the
magma and the crust should thus be between 370 and 650 kg m-3 , with an
average of 510 kg m-3 . Impacts have induced fractures and created pore space
in the lunar rocks decreasing their bulk densities. GRAIL data are consistent
with an average porosity of about 12% in the crust (Wieczorek et al., 2013),
and this porosity could be present in either, or both, of the two units (the
surrounding crust and the magmatic intrusion).
First, the observed density contrast could be due to a pore-free magmatic
intrusion and a pore free highland crust. From the sample densities, this would
give rise to a density contrast of about 510 kg m-3 , which is smaller than the
observed 1- lower bound, and thus is probably too small to account for the
observations. Second, the density contrast could be the result of a fractured
intrusions and a surrounding fractured highland crust. If each had the same
level of porosity, this would give rise to an even smaller density contrast.

6.6. Conclusion

175

Lastly, if the intrusion were unfractured, but the surrounding highland crust
had a porosity of 12%, a density contrast of about 852 kg m-3 could be
achieved, which is close to the observed value.
The best scenario that can account for the observed density contrast at
floor-fractured craters in the highlands is an unfractured basaltic intrusion
that forms within a fractured highland crust. Overall, this implies that the
intrusion is sufficiently young to have escaped being fractured by subsequent
impact events. Given that most basaltic eruptions occurred between 3 and
4 billion years ago, this suggests that the majority of the lunar crust was
fractured before this date.
Our analyses of the gravity anomalies in the South Pole-Aikten basin and
in the maria are less conclusive and are associated with much larger uncertainties. In regard to the SPA basin, although the mean magnitude of the
gravity anomalies for floor-fractured craters is larger than for normal craters,
we show that the difference between the two populations is not significant.
We note, however, that the average density contrast associated with floorfractured craters in the South Pole-Aitken basin is nearly identical to that
obtained for the highlands.
Concerning the mare regions, the corrected gravity anomalies for floorfractured craters are consistent with a mean value for the density contrast
that is considerably smaller than in the highlands. This is in fact consistent
with expectations. If the density contrast were the result of an unfractured
intrusion forming in a fractured basaltic crust (both having the same grain
density), the density contrast would be only about 403 kg m-3 , which is nearly
identical to the mean value found from our analysis.

6.6

Conclusion

The gravitational signature of the floor-fractured crater population, first observed by Schultz (1976a), has been investigated using the unprecedented
resolution of the global gravity model provided by the GRAIL's mission. We
show that the signal at floor-fractured craters in the highlands is consistent
with the presence of a magmatic intrusion at depth below the crater floor.
Derived synthetic gravity anomalies at each FFC compared to observations
show that on average, the density contrast between the magma and the crust
is about 913 kg m-3 . This value is in agreement with the intrusion being composed of unfractured basaltic material and forming in a pre-existing fractured
crust (Wieczorek et al., 2013)
Similar studies have been carried out for floor-fractured craters located
in the South Pole Aikten basin and in the lunar maria. However, the small

176

Chapter 6. Gravitationnal signature of lunar floor-fractured
craters

number of craters as well as the large variability in these two regions prevent
from clearly differentiating the signal due to magmatic intrusions from the
background. In general, two major questions need to be addressed before
carrying out further investigations at floor-fractured crater sites: 1) What is
the origin of the large variability in the magnitude of the gravity anomaly at
normal crater? And 2), how can we better quantify the intrusion thickness at
floor-fractured craters?
Indeed, our results suggest that the impact itself, combined with preexisting density variations within the crust, results in a wide range of Bouguer
anomalies at normal impact craters. Such density structures should also preexist below floor-fractured craters before magma emplacement. To enhance
the intrusion signal, an estimate of the expected initial gravity signature is
desirable.
Additionally, we show that the large variability in the crater depthdiameter relationship makes difficult the determination of the crater depth
itself, and by consequence, the thickness of the magmatic intrusion. This
variability comes from the degradation state of the crater. A quantification
of the degradation state of normal and floor-fractured craters might help to
reduce the uncertainty in the determination of the initial and current floorfractured crater depths and would result in a more accurate derivation of the
density contrast between the magmatic intrusion and the surrounding crust.

Summary and perspectives

179
Intrusive magmatism is a major process at the scale of a planetary body
and, most likely, determinant in the evolution of a terrestrial crust. However,
it takes place deep beneath the surface and remain difficult to study without a proper model for magmatic intrusion emplacement. The objective of
this thesis was two-fold: to characterize the dynamics of a cooling magmatic
intrusion and to shed light on the origin of floor-fractured craters.

Dynamics of a magmatic intrusion in the upper
crust on terrestrial planets.
Summary
In Chapter 3, we propose a model for the cooling of an elastic-plated gravity
current.
and the flow itself results in important deviations from the isoviscous case.
In particular, the spreading of a cooling elastic-plated gravity current is characterized by three phases in both the bending and the gravity regime
* A hot phase where the current spreads as and isoviscous current with
hot viscosity
* A second phase where the current slows down, drastically thickens and
its effective viscosity increases.
* A cold phase where the current returns in an isoviscous spreading but
with a much larger viscosity.
Accordingly, the aspect ratio between the first and the third phase of the
spreading increases by a factor  -2/7 . It is thus able to explain the aspect
ratio of laccoliths observe on Earth and on the Moon.

A.1

Numerical scheme for a cooling elasticplated gravity current

In this section, we present the numerical scheme used to solve the coupled
nonlinear partial differential equations (4.8) and (4.9). The governing equations presented in Chapter 3 are just a particular case where    and can
be solved using  = 105 for instance.

A.1.1

General procedure

The coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (4.8) and (4.9) are solved
on a grid of size M defined by the relation ri = (i-0.5)r for i = 1, .., M . The
grid is shifted at the center to avoid problem arising from the axisymmetrical
geometry. We index the grid point by the indice i and denote the solution
on this grid hi and i and the secondary variables b,i , s,i and i . Both
equations can be expressed on the convenient form
u
-f =0
t

(A.1)

where u is the function we want to integrate and f a non-linear function that
depends on u. We solve these equations by first discretizing all the spatial
derivatives using Finite Difference. The accuracy of the scheme is determined
by the higher order derivatives since their numerical approximation requires
the largest number of sample points. We then get two systems of M ordinary
differential equations with the form
ui
- fi = 0
t

i = 1, ..., M

(A.2)

The time derivatives are first order and, since explicit schemes tend to be very
sensitive and unstable, we use a fully implicit backward Euler scheme to get
un+1
- uni

- fi (un+1
)=0
i
t

i = 1, ..., M

(A.3)

184

Appendix A. Numerical schemes

Since fi (un+1
) is not a linear function, the system above cannot be re-arranged
i
to solve un+1
in term of uni and an iterative method has to be employed instead.
i
Fixed point iteration method have shown poor results in converging toward
the solution and we finally apply second order Newton's method to obtain the
solution at each time step. In particular, we first linearize un+1 around a guess
of the solution by assuming un+1 = u + un , where u is a guess and un is
the error and we drop the i for clarity. Then, we expressed the non-linear part
using a Taylor's expansion
f n+1 = f (un+1 ) = f (u + un ) = f (u ) + Jfh (u )un
where Jfu (u ) is the jacobian matrix for the function f evaluated in h . Injecting the expansion into (A.3) finally gives a system of M linear equations
for the correction term hn which can be expressed as
(I - tJfu (u ))un = un - u + tf (u )

(A.4)

where I is the identity matrix. Therefore, each iteration solves for un and
we use un + un as a new guess u in each iteration. This is repeated until
un becomes sufficiently small. Finally, since the equations are coupled, we
use a fixed-point iteration method to converge toward the solution (h, ) at
each time step. Therefore, the algorithm is the following at each time step
* Start with a guess for the values of all variables.
* Solve the thickness equation (4.8) for hn+1 using Newton-Rhapsod
method.
* Solve the heat equation (4.9) for  n+1 using hn+1 as a new guess for h
and Newton-Rhapsod method.
* Repeat step one until further iterations cease to produce any significant
changes in the values of both hn+1 and  n+1 .
The computational scheme is summarized in the following.

where Ai = ri+1/2 /(ri 2r ) and Bi = ri-1/2 /(ri 2r ). The bending pressure term
P is very stiff and needs a careful treatment. In particular, the fourth order
derivative requires a fourth order central difference scheme and therefore, Pi
is expressed over a seven point stencil on the main grid such that

are evaluated in i - 1/2 and i + 1/2 respectively. Different choices for the
value of the variable at the mid-cell grid point do not show any significant
difference and a simple average is taken such that the variable ui+1/2 is taken
as 0.5(ui + ui+1 ).

Expression of the jacobian Jfh
The discretized function fi can be break down in three part, the gravitational part fig which is expressed in term of the value of h on three grid points
{i - 1, i, i + 1}, the bending part fib which is expressed in term of the value
of h on nine grid points {i - 4, i - 3, ..., i + 3, i + 4} and the injection term
which depends only on the grid point i such that

The different terms can be easily derived from (A.8) and (A.9) with just slight
adjustment coming from the boundary conditions.

The expression of the bending pressure, evaluated over a 7 point stencils, is
problematic close to the boundary and reflection formulae will be used in order
to accommodate the boundary conditions Patankar (1980). In particular, we
have h0 = h1 , h-1 = h2 and h-2 = h3 . Similarly, boundary condition at the

The Newton-Rhapsod method reads

where the k refers to the k iterations, I is a M x M diagonal matrix and
Jfh (h ) is a M x M nona-diagonal matrix. This system of linear equations
can be solved using a nona-diagonal algorithm. At the first iteration, we use
h1 = hn as a first guess and then we iterate using hk = hn + hnk-1 as a new
guess for each iterations until hnk becomes sufficiently small. In particular,
we require that
hnk /hk <

at i - 1/2 (resp. i + 1/2). In addition, we use a classical upwind scheme to

For i = M , we consider that i+1/2 = i and i=1/2 = i . However, the choice
for the boundary condition at the border of the grid i = M is not important
as we solve the problem over a grid much larger than the flow itself.
Newton-Rhapsod method
The Newton-Rhapsod method reads
(I - tJg (k ))kn =  n - k + tf (k )

(A.30)

where the k refers to the k iterations, I is a M x M diagonal matrix and
Jfh (  ) is a M x M tri-diagonal matrix. This system of linear equations can
be solved using a tri-diagonal algorithm. As for the thickness equation, at
the first iteration, we use 1 =  n as a first guess and then we iterate using

n
as a new guess for each iterations until kn becomes sufficiently
k =  n +k-1
small. In particular, we require that

kn /k < 

(A.31)

with  = 10-4 . In addition, at each iteration, the quantity s,k , b,k and k ,
that are needed to evaluate  and , are derived from the value of k using
(4.22), (4.23) and (4.24)

The grid is defined by the relation ri = (i-0.5)r in order to avoid problems at
the center. The point b and a define the face of the control volume surrounding
i such that ra = ri + r/2 and rb = ri - r/2. Because we are using an
axisymmetric geometry, the control volume is an annulus of interior radius rb
and exterior radius ra and its surface is S = (ra2 - rb2 ). Integration of (5.18)
over the control volume surrounding i during a time t gives:

Algorithm

The fully implicit discretization (A.43) can be rewritten as a linear system (h3 )h = J where h is a vector containing the value of h a t + t
and J containing the right hand side of (A.43). The matrix (h3 ) is a
septadiagonal matrix and is solved by using a septadiagonal algorithm.
However, due to the non-linearity of the problem (i.e. the coefficients
Ae , Be , Ag , Bg and S h within the matrix (h3i ) and J depend on h3i ), we
first have to assume values for hi at each grid point to inverse for the
matrix and get the value of h at t + t. We use the following iterative
scheme:
(a) Start with a guess at all grid-point for hi = hni .
(b) Calculate tentative values for the different coefficients of the system
(non linear terms).
(c) Apply the septadiagonal matrix algorithm to solve (A.43) and get
a new value of hi .
(d) With this new hi , we return to step 2 and repeat step 2 to 4 until
further repetitions cease to produce any significant change in hi
- hi |<  where  = 10-4 ).
(i.e. | hnew

The final unchanging state is considered as the solution for the thickness
of the flow at t + t.

Appendix B

Details on the phase diagram

A current in the ith thermal phase can transition in the jth phase of the
gravity regime where i  j. Indeed, the effective viscosity being that
of a small region at the tip in the bending regime and the average flow
viscosity in the gravity regime, it cannot increase during the transition.
Hence, B1 G2 , B1 G3 and B2 G3 are unfeasible (Table B.1 and Figure
B.1 a). In addition, the transition from the third thermal phase of the
bending regime to the first thermal phase of the gravity regime implies
that tct < tb2 and tct > tg3 , which is not possible (Table B.1 and Figure
B.1 a). Therefore, the five possible sequences that remain are B1 G1 ,
B2 G1 , B2 G2 , B3 G2 and B3 G3 (Table B.1 and Figure B.1 a).

Effect of the prewetting film

To mitigate the problem at the contact line, we introduce a thin prewetting film, with thickness hf such that h(r, t)  hf as r   (Section
2.1.3). In this appendix, we discuss the effect of changing the prewetting
thickness hf on some results presented in Chapter 3 and 4.

Similarly, when rescaling the extent of the cold fluid region R(t) - Rc (t)

by hf , the different simulations also collapse on the same curve (Figure

of the more realistic model described in Chapter 4. These scaling laws
are thus able to account for the effect of the prewetting film thickness
hf which is, in general, rather weak.

C.2 Two stage growth in the second bending
phase
In Chapter 4, for some simulations, the second phase of important thickening in the bending regime occurs in two stages: a first stage where
the thickness drastically increases and a second stage where it continues
increasing but much slower (Figure 4.4 and 4.5). To get some insights
into this transition, we run some simulations for  = 1.0 with a higher
spatial resolution, i.e. Dr = 0.005 instead of Dr = 0.01 (Figure C.3).
The simulations show that this transition corresponds to the detachment
of the thermal anomaly (Figure C.3). In particular, during the first
stage, the thermal anomaly is still attached to the tip and the prewetting
film, located beyond r = R(t), is still cooling. In contrast, during the
second stage, which is characterized by a decrease in the thickening
rate, the prewetting film located beyond r = R(t) is entirely cold , i.e.

indeed coincide to the film becoming entirely cold (Figure C.3 a, b, c).

200

Appendix C. Effect of the prewetting film
For the rheology 2 (), the transition is smoother because the viscosity
increases on a wide range of temperature (Figure C.3 d, e, f). Even
if this transition should be present for all the simulations, the smaller
spatial resolution used in this Chapter 3 and 4 does not allow to resolve
this transition for all the combinations of the dimensionless numbers.

Phase diagram

The phase diagram presented in section 4.5 and its application to the
spreading of laccoliths depends on the chosen value for hf . The meaning of the prewetting film thickness in the application to the spreading
of laccolith is unclear. However, reasonable values for hf are values
with physical significance for this structural length scale at the tip of a
laccolith and should range from a few centimeters to no less than 0.1
millimeter. Therefore, as the dependence with hf is weak, a variation of
2 orders of magnitude does not change significantly the results (Figure
C.4).

The same result hold when we look at the relation between the thickness

and therefore, varying hf by two orders of magnitudes change the viscosity contrast by one order of magnitude which is acceptable for our
application.

Floor-fractured craters

D.1 Elastic stresses in the upper elastic
layer
The stress conditions within the crater floor can be approximated using
the small displacement theory. In an axisymmetric geometry, the small
strain-displacement equations at the surface are:

Hence, the stress conditions at the surface are given by Hooke's laws for
a material under plane stress:

(D.7)

The locations of the maximum stresses, where the fractures are the
most likely to initiate, depend on the number  (Figure D.1 a). If the
number  is such that 4 >> C, i.e.  > 10-3 the intrusion reaches
the wall zone in an elastic regime and the maximum stresses are at the
center. For   10-3 , 4  C and the transition to a gravity current
regime occurs at the crater wall zone. In that case, the floor is still
convex but the area of maximum stress is located within a crown at a
given coordinate, intermediate between the center and the wall zone,
i.e. 0 < rmax < 1 (Figure D.1 b). Radial and tangential stresses are of
the same order of magnitude. For a large crater or a shallow intrusion,
i.e. a small value of the number  < 10-3 , the maximum stresses are
concentrated within a crown adjacent to the wall zone upon the intrusion
edge where the elastic deformation is important (Figure D.1 c ). The
radial stresses that develop at the surface are generally larger than the
tangential stresses favoring a circular mode of fracturing.

D.2

Central peak

Central peaks induce an increase in the lithostatic pressure as well as
an increase in the overlying layer elastic thickness directly above the
intrusion center. Herein, we consider an extreme case where the central
peak height is one third of the crater depth and its width is one fourth of
the crater size by introducing an extra gaussian function into the elastic
thickness expression:
Te (r) = Te0 (1 + ((r) + Cp (r)))

Cp (r) = 50

For a strengthless overlying layer and  = 0 (Section 5.4.1 equation
(5.27)), the central peak only adds an excess in lithostatic pressure at
the center of the crater floor. In response, the intrusion preferentially
develops around the central peak and then spreads until it reaches the
crater wall (Figure D.2 a). At the crater wall, the lithostatic pressure
increase induces the thickening of the intrusion. However, due to the

excess of lithostatic pressure at the center, the center of the intrusion below the central peak does not thickens and the thickening only concerns
an annulus located in between the central peak and the crater wall (Figure D.2 a). At the surface, the central peak height decreases until the
thickening is important enough to compensate for the initial excess in
lithostatic pressure. A balance between the two pressures gives the final
height of the central peak, equal to the initial height times (m - c )/m
(Figure D.2 a). Next, the resulting central peak is just leveled up with
the whole crater floor.
For an elastic overlying layer such that  = 10-5 , the inner part of
the intrusion adjacent to the central peak is bent by the weight of the
central peak. As a consequence, during the thickening stage, a second
circular moat, whose size is 4, arises and borders the central peak. As
previously, the central peak height decreases until the sum of the elastic
and hydrostatic pressure compensate for the initial excess of lithostatic

Finally, in the case of a thick elastic overlying layer, i.e. a large value

These calculations were performed on grids that resolved spherical harmonics up to degree 1000, which corresponds to a grid spacing of 2.7
km. When calculating the spherical harmonic coefficients Clm , nmax was
set equal to 9, which is more than sufficient given the small amplitudes
of the magmatic intrusions considered here. Gravity anomalies are presented in mGal, which is 10-5 m s-2 and calculated at a radius r = R0
where R0 is the mean lunar radius.

Effect of the downward continuation filter 

We present the crustal gravity anomaly around two floor-fractured
craters using different values for the downward continuation filter parameter . For the FFC Beals, that is 48 km in diameter, the amplitude
of the gravity anomaly within the crater increases somewhat with increasing , due to the removing of regional negative trends, to reach a

crater that is a 56 km in diameter, models characterized by a  < 80
do not remove enough of the positive regional trend to clearly delineate the central anomaly, while the models characterized by  > 80 are
too restrictive and would remove too much signal at the intrusion scale
(Figure E.1).

Crater depth

The crater depth, dc , is the difference in elevation between the crater
rim and the crater floor. Following Kalynn et al. (2013), we use the
gridded topographic data within a circular region of radius D to derive
the floor elevation and within an annulus bounded by 0.98D and 1.05D
to derive the rim elevation. We use the diameter reported by Head

et al. (2010) and Jozwiak et al. (2012) and assume these to be errorfree. We produce histograms of elevations, binned in 50 m intervals, and
examine the distributions. For the crater floor, the minimum elevation
hmin is affected by later crater deformation such as fractures, subsequent
cratering or in some cases, wall slump and moats. For this reason,
rather than considering the minimum hmin and the mode elevation hmod
to characterize the crater floor depth as in Kalynn et al. (2013), we
consider only the mode of the distribution hmod and we take its value as
the crater floor elevation hfloor . We assign to this value an uncertainty
floor equal to the width of the distribution mode. Concerning the rim
elevation, we follow Kalynn et al. (2013) and take the rim elevation to
be equal to the average of the modal hmode elevation and the maximum
hmax elevation within the crater rim region. We assign an uncertainty to
the rim elevation of rim = (hmode - hmax )/2 (Kalynn et al., 2013). The
crater depth, dc , is the difference in elevation between the floor and the
2
rim, to which we assign an uncertainty equal to d = (f2loor + rim
)1/2 .

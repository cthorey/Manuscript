\chapter{Effect of the prewetting film}
\label{chap:A3}

To  mitigate the  problem at  the contact  line, we  introduce a  thin
prewetting     film,     with     thickness    $h_f$     such     that
$h(r,t)\rightarrow    h_f$   as    $r\rightarrow   \infty$    (Section
\ref{C2-sec:need-regularization}).  The  meaning of a  thin prewetting
film in  the application  to the spreading  of magmatic  intrusions is
unclear.  In  particular, the  model shows  no convergence  when $h_f$
tends to zero \citep{Lister:2013ia} and therefore, the thickness $h_f$
might be  linked to some structural  length scale at the  front of the
laccolith  or  to  the  natural imperfection  of  the  flow  geometry.
Reasonable values for $h_f$ are  values with physical significance for
this structural  length scale at the  tip and should range  from a few
centimeters    to    no    less   than    $0.1$    millimeter,    i.e.
$10^{-4}\le h_f \le 10^{-2}$ . In this appendix, we discuss the effect
of changing the prewetting film  thickness $h_f$ over this interval on
some results presented in Chapter \ref{C3-JFM} and \ref{Heating}.

\section{Scaling laws for the thickness and the radius}

The scaling laws for  the thickness $h_0(t)$ (\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco})
as well as for the  radius $R(t)$ (\ref{C3-ScalingR-Visco}) derived in
Section  \ref{C3-sec:evol-bend-regime} depends  on the  film thickness
$h_f$.

    \caption{Left:    Dimensionless    thickness   at    the    center

      $(\nu,h_f)$ indicated  on the plot.  Dashed-lines  represent the
      scaling   laws   $h_0h_f^{1/11}=   0.7\nu^{-2/11}t^{8/22}$   for
      $\nu = 1.0$ and $0.001$.  Right: Dimensionless radius $R$ versus
      dimensionless   time  $t$   for  the   same  sets   $(\nu,h_f)$.
      Dashed-lines       represent        the       scaling       laws
      $Rh_f^{-1/22}=  2.2\nu^{1/11}t^{7/22}$  for   $\nu  =  1.0$  and
      $0.001$.          Here,        $\Omega=         10^5$        and
      $\eta(\theta)=\eta_1(\theta)$.}

\end{figure}
Accordingly,  when rescaling  the thickness  by $h_f^{-1/11}$  and the
radius by $h_f^{1/22}$, the different simulations collapse on the same
curve (Figure \ref{Scaling_HR_ELAS_APPENDIX}).

Similarly,  when  rescaling  the  extent  of  the  cold  fluid  region
$R(t)-R_c(t)$ by $h_f^{7/66}$, the different simulations also collapse
on the same curve  (Figure \ref{R_Rc_ELAS_APPENDIX}).  Similar results
can  be  obtained for  $R(t)-R_c(t)$  in  the  framework of  the  more
realistic model described in Chapter \ref{Heating}. These scaling laws
are  thus able  to  account  for the  effect  of  the prewetting  film
thickness $h_f$ which is, in general, rather weak.

      we  have  rescaled  the  extent  of the  cold  fluid  region  by

\section{Phase diagram}

The phase diagram presented in section \ref{C4-sec:evol-with-bend} and
its application  to the  spreading of laccoliths  also depends  on the
chosen value for $h_f$. However, as the dependence with $h_f$ is weak,
a variation of  $2$ orders of magnitude does  not change significantly
the results (Figure \ref{C3-PhaseDiagramJFM_Appendix}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }

    \caption{Phase diagram for the  evolution with bending and gravity
      for different  combinations ($\nu$,$Pe_m$) and  different values
      for the film thickness $h_f = 10^{-2}$ and $10^{-4}$.}
    \label{C3-PhaseDiagramJFM_Appendix}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The  same  result hold  when  we  look  at  the relation  between  the
thickness and the  radius of the laccolith  (\ref{C4-Hr}). Indeed, the
best fit value  for the viscosity contrast scales  as $h_f^{-1/2}$ and
therefore,  varying  $h_f$ by  two  orders  of magnitudes  change  the
viscosity contrast by  one order of magnitude which  is acceptable for
our application.   For instance, for  the parameters listed  in Figure
\ref{C4-Data}, the best fit value for the viscosity contrast scales is
$\nu_{\text{best}}\approx        h_f^{-1/2}2.59~10^{-10}$,        i.e.
$\nu_{\text{best}}\approx  2.6\times   10^{-9}$  for   $h_f=0.01$  and
$\nu_{\text{best}}\approx 2.6\times 10^{-8}$ for $h_f=10^{-4}$.


\section{Two stage growth in the second bending phase}
\label{C4-Heat:AppendixC}

In Chapter  \ref{Heating}, for some  simulations, the second  phase of
important thickening  in the  bending regime occurs  in two  stages: a
first stage  where the  thickness drastically  increases and  a second
stage  where   it  continues   increasing  but  much   slower  (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega} and \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).
To get some insights into this transition, we run some simulations for
$\Omega=1.0$  with  a  higher  spatial  resolution,  i.e.   $Dr=0.005$
instead               of               $Dr=0.01$               (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).

The  simulations   show  that  this  transition   corresponds  to  the
detachment       of       the      thermal       anomaly       (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).     In    particular,
during the first  stage, the thermal anomaly is still  attached to the
tip  and  the  prewetting  film, located  beyond  $r=R(t)$,  is  still
cooling.  In contrast, during the second stage, which is characterized
by  a decrease  in the  thickening rate,  the prewetting  film located
beyond $r=R(t)$  is entirely cold  , i.e.  $\overline{\theta}  =0$ for
$r>R(t)$ and the thermal anomaly slowly gets away from the tip (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).   For  instance,  for
$\eta_1(\theta)$, $\nu=0.001$ and  $Pe=100.0$, the transitions between
the two  stages occurs at  $t=1.8~10^{-2}$ and indeed coincide  to the
film          becoming          entirely         cold          (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}  a,  b,  c).   For  the
rheology  $\eta_2(\theta)$, the  transition  is  smoother because  the
viscosity   increases  on   a  wide   range  of   temperature  (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001} d, e,  f). Even if this
transition  should be  present for  all the  simulations, the  smaller
spatial resolution used in this Chapter \ref{C3-JFM} and \ref{Heating}
does not allow to resolve this  transition for all the combinations of
the dimensionless numbers.

\chapter{Influence on the prewetting film thickness}
\label{chap:A2}

The divergence of the viscous stresses at the contact line imposes the
need    for    a    regularization     condition    at    the    front
\citep{Lister:2013ia,Flitton:1999iv,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.     In   this
appendix, we show the limited influenced of the choice of $h_f$.

\section{Scaling laws}

The     different     scaling      laws     derived     in     Section
\ref{C3-sec:evol-bend-regime}   depends   on    the   film   thickness
$h_f$. However, the dependence is confirmed by the numerical solutions
confirmed  numerically  (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS_APPENDIX}  and
\ref{C3-R_Rc_ELAS_APPENDIX})

\section{Second bending phase}
\label{C4-Heat:AppendixC}

For some simulations, the second  phase of important thickening in the
bending regime occurs in two stages: a first stage where the thickness
drastically increases and a second stage where it continues increasing
but   much    slower   (Figure    \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}   and
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).   To get  some insights  into this
transition, we  run some  simulations for  $\Omega=1.0$ with  a higher
spatial  resolution, i.e.   $Dr=0.005$  instead  of $Dr=0.01$  (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).

The  simulations   show  that  this  transition   corresponds  to  the
detachment       of       the      thermal       anomaly       (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).     In    particular,
during the first  stage, the thermal anomaly is still  attached to the
tip  and  the  prewetting  film, located  beyond  $r=R(t)$,  is  still
cooling.  In contrast, during the second stage, which is characterized
by  a decrease  in the  thickening rate,  the prewetting  film located
beyond $r=R(t)$  is entirely cold  , i.e.  $\overline{\theta}  =0$ for
$r>R(t)$ and the thermal anomaly slowly gets away from the tip (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).   For  instance,  for
$\eta_1(\theta)$, $\nu=0.001$ and  $Pe=100.0$, the transitions between
the two  stages occurs at  $t=1.8~10^{-2}$ and indeed coincide  to the
film          becoming          entirely         cold          (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}  a,  b,  c).   For  the
rheology  $\eta_2(\theta)$, the  transition  is  smoother because  the
viscosity   increases  on   a  wide   range  of   temperature  (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001} d, e,  f). Even if this
transition  should be  present for  all the  simulations, the  smaller
spatial resolution used in this  chapter and chapter \ref{C3-JFM} does
not allow to  resolve this transition for all the  combinations of the
dimensionless numbers.

\section{Phase diagram}

The phase  diagram presented in  section \ref{C3-sec:diff-evol-with-1}
and  its application  to the  spreading  of laccolith  depends on  the
chosen value for $h_f$.  The  meaning of the prewetting film thickness
in the application to the spreading of laccolith is unclear.  However,
reasonable values for $h_f$ are  values with physical significance for
this structural  length scale  at the  tip of  a laccolith  and should
range  from  a few  centimeters  to  no  less than  $0.1$  millimeter.
Therefore, as  the dependence with $h_f$  is weak, a variation  of $2$
orders of magnitude does not  change significantly the results (Figure
\ref{C3-PhaseDiagramJFM_Appendix}).

The  same  result hold  when  we  look  at  the relation  between  the
thickness and the  radius of the laccolith  (\ref{C3-Hr}). Indeed, the
best  fit  for   the  value  of  the  viscosity   contrast  scales  as
$h_f^{-1/2}$,  i.e.   $\nu_{\text{best}}=h_f^{-1/2}2.59~10^{-10}$  and
therefore,  varying  $h_f$ by  two  orders  of magnitudes  change  the
viscosity contrast by  one order of magnitude which  is acceptable for
our application.

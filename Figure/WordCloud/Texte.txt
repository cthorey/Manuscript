Lunar
floor
fractured
craters
are
impact
craters
characterized
distinctive
shallow
floors
crossed
important
networks
fractures
Different
scenarios
have
been
proposed
explain
their
formations
but
recent
studies
showed
that
the
intrusion
magma
depth
below
the
crater
floor
the
most
plausible
explanation
The
intrusion
dense
magma
within
the
light
upper
most
part
the
lunar
crust
should
have
positive
signature
the
gravity
field
This
study
takes
advantage
the
unprecedented
resolution
the
lunar
gravity
field
obtained
from
the
NASA
Gravity
Recovery
and
Interior
Laboratory
GRAIL
mission
combination
with
topographic
data
obtained
from
the
Lunar
Orbiter
Laser
Altimeter
LOLA
instrument
investigate
the
gravitational
signatures
both
normal
and
floor
fractured
craters
Despite
the
large
variability
their
gravitational
signatures
the
floor
fractured
and
normal
craters
the
Highlands
show
significant
differences
the
gravitational
anomalies
are
significantly
larger
floor
fractured
craters
The
anomaly
amplitudes
for
floor
fractured
craters
are
agreement
with
synthetic
gravity
anomalies
based
the
predicted
intrusion
shapes
from
theoretical
flow
model
Our
results
are
consistent
with
magmatic
intrusions
intruding
crust
characterized
porosity
and
where
the
intrusion
has
porosity
Similar
studies
have
been
carried
out
the
lunar
maria
and
South
Pole
Aikten
basin
Although
the
average
gravitational

floor
fractured
craters
larger
than
normal
craters
these
regions
they
cannot
distinguished
statistically
due
the
small
number

introduction
There
are
class
impact
craters
the
Moon
that
are
distinguished
having
uplifted
floors
and
radially
concentric
floor
fractured
networks
About
200
these
floor
fractured
craters
FFCs
have
been
identified
Schultz
1976kt
and
these
impact
craters
are
interpreted
have
undergone
endogenous
deformations
after
their
formation
The
most
striking
feature
these
craters
their
shallow
floors
compared
normal
craters
the
same
size
with
the
uplift
reaching
the
initial
crater
depth
some
cases
Schultz
1976kt
Due
this
deformation
their
floors
show
large
networks
radial
concentric
and
pentagonal
fractures
Additionally
depending
local
conditions
the
uplift
results
either
convex
floor
flat
plate
like

sometimes
with
wide
circular
moat
just
interior

The
Bouguer
anomaly
associated
with
magmatic
intrusion
beneath
crater
depends
upon
the
intrusion
characteristics
namely
its
density
and
shape
Recently
showed
that
the

crater

depends
mainly
upon
the

this

Overall
this
implies
that

Given
that

this

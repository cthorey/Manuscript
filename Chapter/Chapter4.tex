\chapter[Towards a more realistic model]{Towards a more realistic model
  and its application to the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions}
\label{Heating}

\minitoc

The previous Chapter was a first  step towards the understanding of the
coupling between  the cooling and  the spreading of  an elastic-plated
gravity  current.   Hereafter,  we  investigate  the  changes  in  the
dynamics  caused by  both the  heating of  the wall  rocks and  a more
realistic  rheology  for  the  magma.    We  then  compare  the  model
predictions with the observations presented in Chapter \ref{chap2}.


\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:introduction}

Numerous  geological  studies  demonstrate  that  magmatic  intrusions
affect  the  host  rock  by  developing  contact-metamorphic  aureoles
\citep{Jaeger:1959du,Galushkin:1997dy,Senger:2014tt}.

    \caption{a)  Sketch of  the granitic  Treasure Mountain  Laccolith
      intruded roughly  $\sim 20$ Ma  years ago in Colorado,  USA. The
      Leadville Limestone (white layer)  was metamorphosed by the heat
      from the intrusion, and was transformed into marble.  During the
      last $10$ Ma, the area was eroded, and the marble as well as the
      laccolith are today exposed at the surface.  b) Cross section of

      exterior  of the  Lincoln  Memorial and  a  variety of  building
      throughout the United States.}
    \label{Treasure}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
 For  instance,
the  Leadville  Limestone  in  Colorado, USA,  famous  for  preserving
fossils  dating   back  to  the  Carboniferous   period,  was  locally
transformed  into  marble  following  the intrusion  of  the  Treasure
Mountain Dome (Figure \ref{Treasure}).  The increase in the geothermal
gradient in  sedimentary basins also  tends to accelerate  the thermal
maturation of organic matter in the surrounding, promoting hydrocarbon
generation   \citep{Senger:2014tt}.    Release    of   CO$_2$   during
metamorphic processes has also been  proposed to help the formation of
ore    deposits   in    the    vicinity    of   magmatic    intrusions
\citep{SILLITOE:1998bs,Ganino:2008ft,Zhou:2008hc}.

The size of  the contact aureole depends on the  context and can reach
more  than  $100\%$  of  the   intrusion  thickness  in  many  regions
\citep{Galushkin:1997dy}.   This contact  aureole,  by insulating  the
flow, may also  affect the dynamics of the  magmatic intrusion itself.
In the following,  we relax the isothermal boundary  condition used in
Chapter \ref{C3-JFM} to investigate its influence on the dynamics.

\section{Theory}
\label{C4-sec:theory-1}

We  consider   the  model  of  elastic-plated   gravity  current  with
temperature-dependent      viscosity     described      in     Section
\ref{C3-sec:theory}  in   which  we  relax  the   isothermal  boundary
condition. In the following, we specify only the changes in the theory
that come  from the new  thermal boundary  condition and we  refer the
reader  to  Section \ref{C3-sec:theory}  for  more  details about  the
derivation.

\subsection{Thermal boundary condition}
\label{C4-sec:formulation-1}

We now consider  the heating of the surrounding medium  by the flowing
magma.  The vertical temperature profile respecting continuity writes
\begin{equation}
  T=
  \begin{cases}
    T_b - (T_b-T_s)(1-\frac{z}{\delta})^2 & 0 \le z\le \delta \\
    T_b & \delta \le z\le h-\delta \\
    T_b - (T_b-T_s)(1-\frac{h-z}{\delta})^2 & h-\delta \le z\le h\\
  \end{cases},
  \label{C4-Temperature}
\end{equation}
where  $\delta(r,t)$   is  the   thermal  boundary   layer  thickness,
$T(r,z,t)$  is  the  temperature  of  the  fluid,  $T_b(r,t)$  is  the
temperature at  the center of  the profile  and $T_s(r,t)$ is  now the
temperature  at the  surface, i.e.   $T(r,z=0,t)=T(r,z=h,t)=T_s(r,t)$.
As in Section \ref{C3-sec:theory}, this profile assures the continuity
of  the temperature  and  heat  flux within  the  flow.  In  addition,
continuity of the heat flux across the flow boundaries requires
\begin{eqnarray}
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                    T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=0}&=&k_r\left.\frac{\partial              T_r}{\partial
                     z}\right|_{z=0}  ,\label{C4-Flux1}\\
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                  T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=h}&=&k_r\left.\frac{\partial            T_r}{\partial
                     z}\right|_{z=h},
                     \label{C4-Flux2}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $T_r(r,z)$ is  the temperature  in the  surrounding medium  and
$k_r$ its  thermal conductivity.  Assuming  a semi infinite  layer for
the rigid layer below  the intrusion, \citet{Carslaw:1959wf} show that
the temperature $T_r$ in the  surrounding rocks can be approximated to
a first order by
\begin{equation}
  T_r(r,z,t)-T_0=(T_{s}-T_0)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(\frac{-z}{2\sqrt{\kappa_r t}}\right)}.
  \label{C4-eq22}
\end{equation}
The  thickness of  the upper  layer is  equal to  the intrusion  depth
$d_0$. However,  we assume that the  depth $d_0$ is large  compared to
the characteristic  length scale  for conduction and  we use  the same
approximation to derive $T_r$ above the intrusion
\begin{equation}
  T_r(r,z,t)-T_0=(T_{s}-T_0)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(\frac{z-h}{2\sqrt{\kappa_r t}}\right)}.
  \label{C4-eq11}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the  two thermal  boundary conditions  (\ref{C4-Flux1}) and
(\ref{C4-Flux2}) become
\begin{eqnarray}
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                    T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=0}&=& k_r
                     \frac{T_{s}-T_{0}}{\sqrt{\pi \kappa_r t}}  ,\label{C4-2Flux_1}\\
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                    T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=h}&=& -k_r
                     \frac{T_{s}-T_{0}}{\sqrt{\pi \kappa_r t}}.
                     \label{C4-2Flux_2}
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Dimensionless equations}
\label{C4-sec:dimens-equat-1}

Except  for   the  conduction  term,   which  now  accounts   for  the
dimensionless    surface   temperature    $\Theta_s$,   the    coupled
dimensionless equations  governing the  cooling of  the flow  are very
similar to (\ref{C3-HF}) and (\ref{C3-TF}) and read
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}-\frac{12}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial      r}
  \left( r I_1(h) \frac{\partial P}{\partial
  r}\right)
  \label{C4-HF}
  & =& \mathcal{H}(\frac{\gamma}{2}-r)\frac{32}{\gamma^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{r^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}\right),\\
  \frac{\partial                                       \xi}{\partial
  t}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial                          r}
  \left( r\left(\bar{u}\xi-\Sigma\right)\right)&=&2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{\delta},\label{C4-TF}
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  \overline{\theta}&=&\frac{1}{3}\left(2\Theta_b+\Theta_s\right)\label{C4-tbar},\\
  \overline{u}&=&\frac{12}{\delta}
                  \frac{\partial
                  P}{\partial
                  r}\left(\delta
                  I_0(\delta)-I_1(\delta)\right),\\
  \Sigma &=& \frac{12}{\delta} \frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\left(I_0(\delta)\left(G(\delta)-\delta\overline{\theta}\right)+\overline{\theta}I_1(\delta)-I_2(\delta)\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where $G(z)$ denotes  a primitive of $\theta(z)$  when $z<\delta$. The
rheology, which couples equations  (\ref{C4-HF}) and (\ref{C4-TF}), is
contained in the  three integrals $I_0(z)$, $I_1(z)$  and $I_2(z)$ and
is discussed  in the  next Section.   The thermal  boundary conditions
(\ref{C4-2Flux_1})  and (\ref{C4-2Flux_2})  reduce in  a dimensionless
form to
\begin{equation}
  2\frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{\delta} = \beta(t)\Theta_s,
  \label{C4-Boundary-Condi}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \beta(t) = \frac{\Omega_1\Omega_2^{-1/2} Pe^{1/2}}{\sqrt{\pi t}}.\label{C4_beta}
\end{equation}
$\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ are two new dimensionless numbers and read
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Omega_1&=&\frac{\kappa_r}{\kappa_m},\label{C4-Omega1}\\
  \Omega_2&=&\frac{k_r}{k_m}.\label{C4-Omega2}
\end{eqnarray}
They represent  the ratio of  wall rocks to magma  thermal diffusivity
(\ref{C4-Omega1})    and   thermal    conductivity   (\ref{C4-Omega2})
respectively.   While the  former should  be close  to $1$,  the latter
could show small variations depending on the nature of the surrounding
rocks  as   well  as  its  porosity   content  \citep{Buttner:1998hy}.
However, variations of both dimensionless numbers will only affect the
size of the  thermal aureole. In this Chapter, we  focus mainly on the
dynamics of  the flow itself and  for a sake of  simplicity, we rather
consider only the combination of both which we call $\Omega$ and reads
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Omega &=& \Omega_1\Omega_2^{-1/2}\\
         &=& \frac{\kappa_r}{\kappa_m}\left(\frac{k_m}{k_r}\right)^{1/2}\label{C4-Omega}.
\end{eqnarray}
It represents  the ratio between  heat conduction at the  contact with
the encasing  rocks and heat  diffusion within the fluid  and quantify
how much heat is transferred to the wall rocks.

As in the precedent Chapter, the heat transport equation (\ref{C4-TF})
is  written  in   terms  of  $\xi$  which   represents  our  ``thermal
variable''.  In that case, $\xi$ writes
\begin{equation}
  \xi&=&\frac{\delta}{3} \left(- 2 \Theta_{b} - \Theta_{s} + 3\right)\label{C4-xi},
\end{equation}
where  we have  used (\ref{C4-tbar})  in (\ref{C4-xi}).   In addition,
rewriting (\ref{C4-Boundary-Condi})  in three  different ways,  we can
obtain  an expression  for $\Theta_s$,  $\delta$ and  $\Theta_b$ as  a
function of the other variables
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Theta_s &=& \frac{2 \Theta_{b}}{\beta \delta + 2}\label{C4-Ts},\\
  \delta  &=&   \frac{1}{\Theta_{s}  \beta}   \left(2  \Theta_{b}   -  2
              \Theta_{s}\right)\label{C4-D},\\
  \Theta_b &=& \frac{\Theta_{s}}{2} \left(\beta \delta + 2\right)\label{C4-Tb}.
\end{eqnarray}
When the thermal boundary layers  have just merged, then $\Theta_b=1$,
$\delta = h/2$ and injecting (\ref{C4-Ts}) into (\ref{C4-xi}) gives
\begin{equation}
  \xi_t(t)=\frac{\beta(t) h^{2}{\left (r,t \right )}}{6 \beta(t) h{\left (r,t \right )}
    + 24}.\label{C4-xit}
\end{equation}
Therefore,  when  $\xi<\xi_t$, the  thermal  boundary  layers are  not
merged, $\Theta_b=1$ and injecting (\ref{C4-D}) into (\ref{C4-xi}) and
solving for $\Theta_s$ gives
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_s = \frac{3 \beta}{4} \xi - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \sqrt{\beta \xi \left(3 \beta \xi + 8\right)} + 1.
\end{equation}
In  contrast,  when  $\xi>\xi_t$,  the thermal  boundary  layers  have
merged,  $\delta=h/2$ and  injecting (\ref{C4-Tb})  into (\ref{C4-xi})
and solving for $\Theta_s$ gives
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_s = \frac{- 12 \xi + 6 h}{\left(\beta h + 6\right) h}.
\end{equation}

In the end, we then have
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_s(r,t)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{3 \beta}{4} \xi - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \sqrt{\beta \xi \left(3 \beta \xi + 8\right)} + 1 & \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \\
    \frac{- 12  \xi +  6 h{\left  (r,t \right  )}}{\left(\beta h{\left
            (r,t  \right  )} +  6\right)  h{\left  (r,t \right  )}}  &
    \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi > \xi_t
  \end{cases},
  \label{C4-TS}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_b(r)=
  \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } \hspace{1cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \\
    \frac{\Theta_{s}}{4}  \left(\beta(t)  h{\left  (r,t  \right  )}  +
      4\right) & \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi > \xi_t
  \end{cases},
  \label{C4-TB}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \delta(r)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\Theta_{s} \beta(t)} \left(- 2 \Theta_{s} + 2\right) &\text{if } \hspace{1cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \\
    h(r,t)/2 & \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi > \xi_t
  \end{cases},
  \label{C4-DELTA}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  \xi_t(t)&=&\frac{\beta(t) h^{2}{\left (r,t \right )}}{6 \beta(t) h{\left (r,t \right )}
              + 24}.
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Rheology}
\label{C4-sec:rheology}

The  model derived  in  Section  \ref{C4-sec:dimens-equat-1} does  not
assume  a specific  relation  between viscosity  and temperature.  The
choice of the rheology $\eta(T)$,  which is contained in the integrals
$I_0(z)$, $I_1(z)$ and $I_2(z)$, remains to be defined.  

In  Section  \ref{C3-sec:theory},  we assumed  a  viscosity  inversely
dependent on the temperature which reads in a dimensional form
\begin{equation}
  \eta_1(T)=\frac{\eta_h
    \eta_c(T_i-T_0)}{\eta_h(T_i-T_0)+(\eta_c-\eta_h)(T-T_0)},
\end{equation}
where $\eta_h$  and $\eta_c$  are the viscosities  of the  hottest and
coldest  fluid  at  the   temperature  $T_i$  and  $T_0$  respectively
\citep{Bercovici:2007vc}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Rheology.eps}
    \caption{Dimensionless viscosity  versus dimensionless temperature
      for  both  rheologies  $\eta_1$ (\ref{C4-rheo-1})  and  $\eta_2$
      (\ref{C4-rheo-2}) using $\nu=0.001$.}
    \label{C4-Rheology}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
While  this model  possesses some  nice simplification  properties, it
restricts  the  change  in  viscosity   to  a  very  narrow  range  of
temperatures    close   to    $T=T_0$,   i.e.     $\theta=0$   (Figure
\ref{C4-Rheology}).     In     contrast,    the     Arrhenius    model
($\eta \sim  \exp(-k/T)$), which is  a more realistic model  to relate
temperature      and       viscosity      for       silicate      melt
\citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Blatt:2ViMWPc0,Crisp:1990gf,Costa:2003wk},
describes  a viscosity  that increases  over  a much  larger range  of
temperatures (Figure  \ref{C4-Rheology}).  To  get some  insights into
the  effect of  a more  realistic temperature-dependent  viscosity, we
thus also use a first-order approximation  of the Arrhenius model as a
second rheology $\eta_2(T)$ \citep{Diniega:2013eh}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta_2(T)                          =                          \eta_h
  \exp\left(-\log\left(\frac{\eta_h}{\eta_c}\right)\left(1-\frac{T-T_0}{T_i-T_0}\right)\right).
\end{eqnarray}
In a dimensionless form, they read
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta_1(\theta)/\eta_h&=&\frac{1}{\nu+(1-\nu)\theta} ,\label{C4-rheo-1}\\
  \eta_2(\theta)/\eta_h&=&\exp\left(-\log(\nu)\left(1-\theta\right)\right),  \label{C4-rheo-2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\nu$  is the viscosity  contrast which is described  in Section
\ref{C3-sec:theory} and represents the ratio between the hot viscosity
$\eta_h$  and   the  cold  viscosity  $\eta_c$.    The  expression  of
$I_0(\delta)$, $I_1(\delta)$, $I_1(h)$ and $I_2(\delta)$, necessary to
close the model, are  given in Appendix \ref{A1-sec:-cool-elast-plat}
  for both rheologies.

\subsection{Comparison with the isothermal model}
\label{C4-sec:some-limits}

We showed that relaxing the isothermal boundary condition introduces a
new dimensionless number $\Omega$ which  controls how much heat can be
transferred    to   the    surrounding    rocks.     In   the    limit
$\Omega \rightarrow \infty$, the model should thus reduce to the model
described    in    Section    \ref{C3-sec:theory}.     Indeed,    when
$\Omega\rightarrow \infty$, the  coefficient $\beta\rightarrow \infty$
and then $\xi_t\rightarrow  h/6$ (Section \ref{C3-sec:heat-equation}).
When $\xi<\xi_t$, injecting the corresponding expression of $\Theta_s$
(\ref{C4-TS})   in   the    corresponding   expression   of   $\delta$
(\ref{C4-DELTA}) gives
\begin{equation}
  \delta =\frac{3 \beta \xi +\sqrt{3} \sqrt{\beta \xi (3 \beta \xi +8)}+8}{2 \beta },
\end{equation}
which indeed  tends to  $3\xi$ when $\beta  \rightarrow \infty$  as in
Section \ref{C3-sec:heat-equation}.   When $\xi>\xi_t$,  injecting the
corresponding   expression   of   $\Theta_s$  (\ref{C4-TS})   in   the
corresponding expression of $\Theta_b$ (\ref{C4-TB}) gives
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_b = \frac{3 (\beta  h+4) (h-2 \xi )}{2 h (\beta  h+6)},
\end{equation}
which   also   tends  to   the   expression   previously  found   when
$\beta    \rightarrow    \infty$,    i.e.     $3/2-3\xi/h$    (Section
\ref{C3-sec:heat-equation}). Finally,  taking the limit  of $\Theta_s$
for both $\xi>\xi_t$ and $\xi<\xi_t$ show that $\Theta_s$ indeed tends
to zero when $\Omega\rightarrow \infty$.

For magmatic intrusions,  the thermal parameters of the  magma and the
encasing rocks are similar and the dimensionless  number $\Omega$ would
be close to $1$. In the following, we study the effect of relaxing the
isothermal   boundary  condition   on   the   dynamics  by   comparing
$\Omega=10^5$ and  $\Omega = 1$  in both regimes separately.   We also
investigate  the effect  of  a  more realistic  rheology  on the  flow
dynamics.

      (\ref{C4-eq11})    and   reads    in   a    dimensionless   form
      $\Theta_r(r,z,t)=\Theta_s(r,t)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(Pe^{1/2}\Omega_1\frac{(z-h)}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)}$
      where $\Omega_1$ is set to  $1$. The thermal structure below the
      intrusion is similar and not shown for clarity.}

\section{Evolution in the bending regime}
\label{C4-sec:evol-bend-regime-1}

We  follow the  same approach  as in  the previous  Chapter and  first
concentrate  on the  case in  which  only bending  contributes to  the
dynamic pressure.  The governing  equations are thus (\ref{C4-HF}) and
(\ref{C4-TF})  where  $P  =  \nabla_r^4h$.   For  isothermal  boundary
conditions, we show that the dynamics in the bending regime depends on
the average  viscosity of a small  region at the front  of the current
and can be divided into three phases. Hereafter, we first describe how
the thermal  boundary condition  influences the  timing for  the phase
transition  by looking  at  two values  for  the dimensionless  number
$\Omega$,     i.e.       $\Omega=1$     and      $\Omega=10^5$     and
$\eta(\theta)=\eta_1(\theta)$.   We  then  investigate the  effect  of
changing the rheology.

\subsection{Relaxing  the   thermal  boundary  condition,   effect  of
  $\Omega$}
\label{C4-sec:infl-therm-bound-el}

The heating of the surrounding  medium insulates the flow. The thermal
anomaly     is     hence     larger     for     $\Omega=1$     (Figure
\ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating}).   For  instance, for  $\nu=0.001$  and
$Pe=1.0$, while the thermal anomaly extends over $50\%$ of the current
for $\Omega  = 10^5$ at  $t=10$, it makes up  more than $75\%$  of the
flow    for    $\Omega=1$   (Figure    \ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating}).
Nevertheless, the  tip of the current  rapidly cools and a  cold fluid
region  also forms  at the  front when  relaxing the  thermal boundary
condition.

Hence, the dynamics for $\Omega=1$ also passes through three different
phases.   The current  first behaves  as an  isoviscous flow  with hot
viscosity, it then slows down and  thickens to finally behave again as
an   isoviscous    flow   but   with   a    cold   viscosity   (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).  As the current tip remains hot for a
longer period, the transitions to the second and third bending
regime are however delayed relatively to the case where $\Omega= 10^5$
(Figure    \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).     For   instance,    for
$\nu=10^{-3}$ and $Pe=1.0$, while the transition to the second bending
phase already begins at $t\sim 10^{-6}$ for $\Omega=10^{5}$, it occurs
only    after   $t\sim    10^{-5}$   for    $\Omega=   1.0$    (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).

In addition, the second phase of thickening shows two different stages
for $\Omega =  1.0$ and $Pe=100.0$, a first stage  where the thickness
drastically  increases  and  a  second stage  where  it  continues  to
increase     but     at     a     much     slower     rate     (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).  This transition, enhanced by the new
thermal  boundary condition,  reflects the  detachment of  the thermal
anomaly  in the  second bending  phase  and is  discussed in  Appendix
\ref{C4-Heat:AppendixC}.

\subsection{Considering   a  more   realistic   rheology,  effect   of
  $\eta(\theta)$}
\label{C4-sec:eta_influence-el}


The first  order Arrhenius rheology $\eta_2(\theta)$  widens the range
of temperature over which significant viscosity variation occurs, i.e.
$\sim80\%$   of  the   temperature   range   against  $\sim10\%$   for
$\eta_1(\theta)$ (Figure \ref{C4-Rheology}).

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology.eps}
    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless time $t$ for  different sets $(\eta,Pe)$ indicated
      on      the      plot.        Dotted-line:      scaling      law
      $h_0=  0.7h_f^{-1/11}\nu^{-2/11}t^{8/22}$  for  $\nu  =  0.001$.
      Right: Dimensionless  radius $R$  versus dimensionless  time $t$

      simulations, $\nu=0.001$ and $\Omega=1.0$.}
    \label{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Therefore, the effective flow viscosity  starts to increase sooner and
the transition to the second bending  phase occurs sooner than for the
rheology     previously     considered    $\eta_1(\theta)$     (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).   For instance,  for $\nu=10^{-3}$
and  $Pe=1.0$,  while the  second  phase  of  the flow  starts  around
$t\sim 10^{-5}$  for the  rheology $\eta_1(\theta)$, it  starts around
$t\sim   10^{-6}$   for    the   rheology   $\eta_2(\theta)$   (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).   In  particular,  the  change  in
rheology almost compensates for the delay caused by the heating of the
surrounding medium. For  instance, the transition time  for the second
bending phase  for a  flow characterized by  $\eta=\eta_1(\theta)$ and
$\Omega=10^5$  is almost  the same  than for  a flow  characterized by
$\eta=\eta_2(\theta)$          and         $\Omega=1$          (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega} and \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).

\subsection{Characterization of the thermal anomaly}
\label{C4-sec:char-therm-anom}

As  in Chapter  \ref{C3-JFM},  we  quantify the  size  of the  thermal
anomaly  through   a  critical  thermal  radius   $R_c(t)$  where  the
temperature  at the  center of  the flow  $\Theta_b$ is  $1\%$ of  the
injection temperature,  i.e.  $\Theta_b(r=0)-\Theta_b(r=R_c)=0.99$. As
expected,  the thermal  anomaly is  larger when  relaxing the  thermal
boundary condition and changing the rheology $\eta(\theta)$ has almost
no        effect        on         its        evolution        (Figure
\ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_Rheol_Boundary}). 

In  addition, the  extent of  the cold  fluid region  $R(t)-R_c(t)$ is
growing  slightly  slower with  time  when  considering $\Omega=1$  in
comparison  to  the  isothermal boundary  case  $\Omega=10^5$  (Figure
\ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_Rheol_Boundary}).  In the  following, we characterize
the  thermal  anomaly  evolution  in the  more  realistic  case  where
$\Omega=1$ and $\eta(\theta)=\eta_2(\theta)$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{ELAS_RRc_Rheol_Boundary.eps}
    \caption{Left:  Extent  of  the cold  fluid  region  $R(t)-R_c(t)$
      versus   dimensionless    time   for    different   combinations
      ($\eta$,$\Omega$)   indicated  on   the  plot,   $\nu=0.01$  and
      $Pe=1.0$. Same plot but for $Pe=100.0$.}
    \label{C4-ELAS_RRc_Rheol_Boundary}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As in Section \ref{C3-sec:char-therm-anom-e},  the size of the thermal
anomaly $R_c(t)$  is given by  the radius  where advection of  heat is
equal to heat loss
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{d    t}\left(\theta(r=   R_c,t)\right)    \approx   Pe^{-1}
  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\left(\theta(r=R_c,t)\right),
  \label{C4-HeatequationThermal}
\end{equation}
which, by integration over the thickness of the flow $h$, becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_0^h\theta           dz\right)-\Theta_s\frac{d
  h}{dt}&\approx& Pe^{-1} \frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{h}\nonumber\\
  \overline{\theta}\frac{d h}{dt}+h\frac{d \overline{\theta}}{dt}-\Theta_s\frac{d
  h}{dt}&\approx& Pe^{-1}
                  \frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{h}\nonumber\\
  \frac{2}{3}\left(\Theta_b-\Theta_s\right)\frac{d h}{d t} +h\frac{d\overline{\theta}}{dt}&\approx& Pe^{-1}
                                                                                                    \frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{h},\label{C4-Calcul2}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\overline{\theta}$  is equal to $(\int_0^h  \theta dz)/h$ here.
Using     the     thickness     profile     (\ref{C3-IntrusionShape}),
(\ref{C4-Calcul2}) becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
  \alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2\left(\frac{2}{3}\left(\Theta_b-\Theta_s\right)\frac{d h_0}{d
  t}+h_0\frac{d \overline{\theta}}{d
  t}\right)+&\nonumber\\
  \frac{8h_0R_c^2\left(\Theta_b-\Theta_s\right)}{3R^3}\frac{d
  R}{d
  t}\alpha\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)                        &\approx
                                                                \frac{Pe^{-1}\left(\Theta_b-\Theta_s\right)}{\alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2h_0},
                                                                \label{C4-bill}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha  (t)$ is the  normalized region beyond  $r=R_c(t)$, i.e.
$\alpha(t)= \left(R(t)-R_c(t)\right)/R(t)$. 

In  the limit  $\alpha<<1$, i.e.   $R_c/R\sim 1$,  and neglecting  the
higher order terms in  (\ref{C4-bill}) ($\propto \alpha^2$), we obtain
the same scaling law for the  size of the normalized cold front region
$\alpha$ than the one found in Section \ref{C3-sec:char-therm-anom-e}.
However, it  clearly does not  match the prediction  when $\Omega=1.0$
(Figure \ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0}) and  the new thermal anomaly
evolution must be linked to a  change in the heat advection rate, i.e.
the left hand side term in the balance (\ref{C4-bill}).  

Neglecting the advection term to  keep only the inflation term instead
in (\ref{C4-bill}) leads to
\begin{equation}
  \alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2\frac{d h_0}{d
    t}\approx \frac{Pe^{-1}}{\alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2h_0},
\end{equation}
which, in the limit $\alpha<<1$, becomes
\begin{equation}
  \alpha^4\frac{\partial h_0}{\partial
    t} \approx \frac{Pe^{-1}}{h_0\frac{\partial h_0}{\partial t}}.
\end{equation}
Substituting    $h_0(t)$    by     its    respective    scaling    law
(\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco}), the  relative size  of the  normalized cold
front region $\alpha$ reads
\begin{equation}
  \alpha(t) \propto h_f^{1/22}\nu^{1/11}Pe^{-1/4}t^{7/44},
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
  R(t)-R_c(t) = 0.7h_f^{1/11}\nu^{2/11}Pe^{-1/4}t^{17/44},
  \label{C4-ScalingRRc-Heating}
\end{equation}
where the numerical prefactor, which  depends on the definition of the
thermal anomaly, has been chosen to fit the simulations.

      all           simulations,            $\Omega=1.0$           and
      $\eta(\theta)=\eta_2(\theta)$.}
    \label{C4-ELAS_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

This new scaling law for the evolution of the extent of the cold fluid
region (\ref{C4-ScalingRRc-Heating}) shows a  much better fit with the
simulations  (Figure \ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0}  b). Indeed,  in
that case, the  constant heating of the surrounding  medium limits the
expansion of  the cold  fluid region in  comparison to  the isothermal
case. In  particular, the  thermal anomaly  reaches the  third bending
phase much  later and  therefore, the scaling  law corresponds  to the
evolution of the thermal anomaly in  the second bending phase; a phase
dominated  by  inflation.  Therefore,  the  evolution  of the  thermal
anomaly is  governed by the inflation  rate at the intrusion  tip when
relaxing the thermal boundary condition.

The cold fluid  region grows effectively slightly slower,  with a time
exponent  equal  to $17/44$  instead  of  $9/22$ ($17/44  \sim  0.38$,
$9/22\sim  0.40$) and  the dependence  in  the Peclet  number $Pe$  is
weaker, i.e.   it changes from  a power  $1/3$ to $1/4$.   Indeed, for
small $Pe$,  vertical diffusion is  efficient on the  emplacement time
scale and  rapidly heats up the  surrounding medium. The heat  loss in
the interior is  smaller and the thermal anomaly  larger in comparison
to the  case where $\Omega= 10^5$.   In contrast, for large  values of
$Pe$, advection dominates and the saving of heat by insulation is less
important decreasing  the overall  difference between small  and large
values of $Pe$.

      viscosity by $\nu$ and the time by $t_{b3}$. In all simulations,
      $\Omega=1.0$ and $\eta(\theta)=\eta_2$.}
    \label{C4-Visco_ELAS_Heating}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As  we  show  in Section  \ref{C4-sec:eta_influence-el},  the  time
$t_{b2}$ for  the current to enter  the second bending phase  does not
change much  as the delay  induced by  the heating of  the surrounding
medium is offset  by the change in rheology.  Accordingly,  we use the
time      $t_{b2}$     (\ref{C3-tb2})      defined     in      Section
\ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-e}  as   the  time  to  cool   the  thin
prewetting film  to characterize the first  bending transition (Figure
\ref{C4-Visco_ELAS_Heating} a). In contrast, the time $t_{b3}$ for the
current to enter the third phase of the flow is now larger. Processing
as    in    Section   \ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-e}    but    using
(\ref{C4-ScalingRRc-Heating})  for the  evolution  of  the cold  fluid
region $R(t)-R_c(t)$  instead of  (\ref{C3-ScalingRRc}), we  find that
$t_{b3}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  t_{b3}=0.4h_f^{-4/17}\nu^{-8/17}Pe^{11/17}St_m^{-11/17}.
  \label{C4-tb3}
\end{equation}

\section{Evolution in the gravity regime}
\label{C4-sec:evol-grav-regime}

As in Chapter \ref{C3-JFM}, we now  consider the late time behavior in
which only the weight of the fluid contributes to the dynamic pressure
$P$. The governing equations are (\ref{C4-HF}) and (\ref{C4-TF}) where
$P=h$. We follow the same framework as in the previous Section.

      $\nu=0.01$. The  thermal structure above the  intrusion is given
      by   (\ref{C4-eq11})  and   reads   in   a  dimensionless   form
      $\Theta_r(r,z,t)=\Theta_s(r,t)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(Pe^{1/2}\Omega_1\frac{(z-h)}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)}$
      where $\Omega_1$ is set to  $1$. The thermal structure below the
      intrusion is similar and not shown for clarity.}
    \label{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Relaxing  the   thermal  boundary  condition,   effect  of
  $\Omega$}
\label{C4-sec:infl-therm-bound-gr}

As in the  bending regime, for a small value  of $\Omega$, the heating
of  the  surrounding medium  insulates  the  current and  the  thermal
anomaly is larger. For instance, for $Pe=1$ and $\nu=0.01$ at $t=100$,
while  $R_c\sim 1$  for $\Omega=10^5$,  $R_c$ is  larger than  $5$ for
$\Omega =1 $ (Figure \ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}).  

In  addition, after  it detaches  from  the current  tip, the  thermal
anomaly does not  reach a steady-state profile but  keeps growing with
time instead (Figure \ref{C4-Grid_TIME_GRAV}).  Indeed, in contrast to
the isothermal  boundary case,  the constant  increase of  the surface
temperature continuously decreases the heat loss in the central region
of the current which allows an expansion of the thermal anomaly.
\begin{figure}[h!]

      isotherms for  $\theta =  0.2$, $0.4$,  $0.6$ and  $0.8$.  Here,
      $\nu=0.01$,  $Pe =1.0$  and $St_m  = 1$.  The thermal  structure

      $\Theta_r(r,z,t)=\Theta_s(r,t)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(Pe^{1/2}\Omega_1\frac{(z-h)}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)}$

      intrusion is similar and not shown for clarity.}
    \label{C4-Grid_TIME_GRAV}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

For small  values of $Pe$,  the important heating of  the surrounding
medium results in a flow  that is almost vertically isothermal (Figure
\ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}  and \ref{C4-Grid_TIME_GRAV}).   In
contrast, for large values of $Pe$,  the vertical diffusion of heat is
less efficient,  the thermal aureole  is restricted to a  small region
around the intrusion,  the thermal anomaly is larger  and the vertical
temperature   gradients   within   the  flow   are   stronger   (Figure
\ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}).

      simulations, $\nu=0.01$ and $\eta(\theta)=\eta_1$.}
    \label{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

While three  phases also characterize the  dynamics when $\Omega=1.0$,
their  duration is  modified  by the  new  thermal boundary  condition
(Figure \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega}).   In particular,  the current
remains hot  for a longer  period and the  second phase is  delayed in
comparison  to  the case  where  $\Omega  =10^5$.  For  instance,  for
$\nu=0.01$  and  $Pe=1.0$,  while   the  first  transition  occurs  at
$t \approx 0.1$ for $\Omega=10^5$,  it happens only after $t\approx 1$
for $\Omega=1$ (Figure \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega}).

As the thermal  anomaly does not reach a steady  state for $\Omega=1$,
the cooling of the current in  the second gravity phase is also slower
than for  $\Omega=10^5$ and the  current reaches the third  phase also
much later for $\Omega=1$ (Figure \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega}).  In
the next Section,  we consider the effect of the  first order Arrhenius
rheology on the dynamics for $\Omega=1.0$.

\subsection{Considering   a  more   realistic   rheology,  effect   of
  $\eta(\theta)$}
\label{C4-sec:cons-more-real-1}
 
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Scaling_HR_GRAV_Rheology.eps}

      $\nu=0.01$.     Right:   Dimensionless    radius   $R$    versus

    \label{C4-HR_GRAV_Rheology}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As  in the  bending regime,  the chosen  rheology $\eta(\theta)$  also
affects the timing for the phase transition, and, in particular, these
transitions  occur  sooner  for  the first  order  Arrhenius  rheology
$\eta_2(\theta)$ than  for $\eta=\eta_1(\theta)$.  In  particular, the
delay  induced  in  the  phase  transitions  by  the  heating  of  the
surrounding  medium is  almost  offset by  the  first order  Arrhenius
rheology.  For  instance, the transition  to the second  gravity phase
occurs  around   the  same  time   for  a  current   characterized  by
$\eta(\theta)   =\eta_1$   and   $\Omega=10^5$  than   for   a   current
characterized  by  $\eta(\theta)  =\eta_2$ and  $\Omega=1.0$  (Compare
Figure \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega} and \ref{C4-HR_GRAV_Rheology}).

\subsection{Characterization of the thermal anomaly}
\label{C4-sec:char-therm-anom-2}

As in the bending regime, the thermal anomaly is first attached to the
tip of the current, i.e. $R_c(t)/R(t)=1$. After a time that depends on
$Pe$, as well as $\nu$, the  thermal anomaly detaches from the tip and
follows  its own  evolution. However,  in contrast  to the  isoviscous
case, the  thermal anomaly does not  reach a steady state  and $R_c/R$
does     not     evolve      as     $t^{-1/2}$     anymore     (Figure
\ref{C4-GRAV_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0} a).  We modify  the thermal budget of
Section \ref{C3-sec:char-therm-anom-g}  to account for the  heating of
the surrounding medium.

\end{figure}

When  the thermal  anomaly has  detached from  the intrusion  front, a
balance between heat advection and diffusion in the surrounding medium
in a dimensional form reads
\begin{equation}
  \rho_m C_{p,m} U_0 \frac{\Delta T}{R_c} \approx k_m \frac{\Delta T}{h_0^2},
  \label{C4-bilan}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta  T$ is the  mean temperature contrast between  the fluid
and the  surroundings and $U_0$  is a redistribution of  the injection
rate at  $r=R_c$, i.e.   $U_0=Q_0/(2\pi R_c  h_0)$.  In  addition, the
continuity of the heat flux at the boundary (\ref{C4-2Flux_1}) imposes
\begin{equation}
  k_m\frac{\Delta   T}{h_0}\approx   k_r   \frac{\Delta   T}{\sqrt{\pi
      \kappa_r t}}.
  \label{C4-FluxEstimate}
\end{equation}
Injecting (\ref{C4-FluxEstimate}) and the  expression for the velocity
$U_0$ into (\ref{C4-bilan}) gives
\begin{equation}
  R_c \approx  \left(\frac{Q_0\kappa_r^{1/2}}{\kappa_m k_r}\right)^{1/2}
  t^{1/4}.
  \label{C4-Bilan2}
\end{equation}
By non-dimensionalizing (\ref{C4-Bilan2}), we  obtain the evolution of
the   thermal   anomaly   when   it  has   detached   from   the   tip
$R_c(t)\sim \Omega^{-2}Pe^{1/4}t^{1/4}$ and hence
\begin{equation}
  \frac{R_c(t)}{R(t)} = 1.8\Omega^{-2}Pe^{1/4}\nu^{-1/8}t^{-1/4},
  \label{C4-Rc}
\end{equation}
where   we  have   used  the   scaling   law  for   $R(t)$  given   by
(\ref{C3-scaling-R-gravi-2})  and   the  numerical   prefactor,  which
depends on the  definition of the thermal anomaly, has  been chosen to
fit  the  simulations.  The  scaling  law,  which  is only  valid  for
$\Omega = O(1)$,  indeed closely fits the  simulations. In particular,
both  the dependence  with the  Peclet number  $Pe$ and  the viscosity
contrast  vanish  when  rescaling  by  $Pe^{1/4}\nu^{-1/8}$  (Figure
\ref{C4-GRAV_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0} b).

    \label{C4-Visco_GRAV_Heating}

The time  $t_{g2}$ for the current  to enter the second  gravity phase
does  not change  much as  the  delay induced  by the  heating of  the
surrounding medium is offset by  the change in rheology.  Accordingly,
we  use the  time $t_{g2}$  (\ref{C3-tg2}) to  characterize the  first
gravity   transition  (Figure   \ref{C4-Visco_GRAV_Heating}  a).    In
contrast, the time  $t_{g3}$ for the current to enter  the third phase
of   the   flow   is   now   larger.    Processing   as   in   Section
\ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-g}  but  using   (\ref{C4-Rc})  for  the
evolution of  the normalized thermal anomaly  $R_c(t)/R(t)$ instead of
(\ref{C3-Scaling-Rc-Gravy}), we find that $t_{g3}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  t_{g3}= 1300 \Omega^{-8}\nu^{-1/2}Pe St_m^{-1}.

\section{Evolution  with bending  and  gravity in  the more  realistic
  model}
\label{C4-sec:evol-with-bend}

In the  previous Chapter,  we showed  that the  final evolution  of an
elastic-plated gravity  current depends on the  relative phase changes
within  each regime  and the  transition between  the bending  and the
gravity regime  itself.  The  Arrhenius rheology  tends to  offset the
delays caused by the heating of the surrounding medium and overall, the
phase  diagram  presented in  Section  (\ref{C3-sec:diff-evol-with-1})
shows         only         minor         modifications         (Figure
\ref{C4-Phase_Diagram_Heating}).  Except for  the transitions from the
third bending phase to the second  and third gravity phases, which are
shifted  to  the  left,  the  phase diagram  is  indeed  not  modified
(Appendix  \ref{chap:A2}). Therefore,  in  the framework  of our  more
realistic model, the current is only  more likely to transition to the
gravity  regime  before reaching  the  third  bending phase.   In  the
following,  we   look  at   the  observations  discussed   in  Chapter
\ref{chap2} in the light of our new model.

intrusions]{Application   to  the   spreading   of  shallow   magmatic
  intrusions}
\label{C4-sec:appl-spre-shall}

\subsection{Elba Island christmas-tree laccolith complex}
\label{C4-sec:appl-arrest-terr}

The isoviscous elastic-plated  gravity current model has  been used in
Chapter   \ref{chap2}  to   study  the   laccoliths  at   Elba  Island
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}. It shows that, while their final morphology is
consistent with their  arrest in the bending  regime, their dimensions
require  unreasonable magma  viscosity  to agree  with the  isoviscous
model  (Chapter   \ref{chap2}).   In  addition,  given   the  fracture
toughness  of rocks,  their  radius  seems too  small  to be  fractured
controlled and their arrest might be better explained by their cooling
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}.

In the following, we compare the  new model predictions to the size of
laccoliths  provided by  \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}.   To  account for  the
intrinsic scale of  different settings for each  intrusion and compare
them to the model, the data  have first to be nondimensionalized using
characteristic values for the model parameters.

\subsubsection*{Range of values for the dimensionless numbers}
\label{C4-sec:range-valu-dimens-el}
 
The  different parameters  along  with a  discussion  on the  possible
values for  $h_f$ have  been provided in  Chapter \ref{chap2}  and are
summarized  in Table  \ref{C4-tab}.  We  refer the  reader to  Section
\ref{C2-sec:observ-vs-pred-Earth}   for  more   details  about   their
derivation.   In the  following, we  quantify  the values  of the  new
dimensionless numbers related to the cooling  of the flow for the case
of the Elba Island laccoliths.

For a latent heat of crystallization $L = 4.18\times10^5$ J kg$^{-1}$,
a   difference  between   solidus  temperature   $T_S$  and   liquidus
temperature  $T_L$ between  $100$ K  and  $300$ K,  the number  $St_m$
varies from $0.1$  to $0.5$.  For a thermal diffusivity  for the magma
equal to $\kappa_m=  10^{-6}$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$, an  injection rate $Q_0$
between $0.1$ and $100$ m$^3$  s$^{-1}$ and an intrusion depth between
$0.2$ and $2.7$  km, the Peclet number varies from  $10^{-3}$ to $100$
and therefore,  $Pe_m$ varies from  $0.01$ to $1000$. The  increase in
viscosity upon cooling varies from $4$  to $6$ orders of magnitude for
mafic magmas  and can  be up  to $10$ orders  of magnitude  for felsic
magmas
\citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Lejeune:1995fc,Giordano:2008em,Diniega:2013eh}.
We  thus  consider  that  the viscosity  contrast  $\nu$  ranges  from
$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-10}$.

\subsubsection*{Do laccoliths stop in the bending regime?}
\label{C4-sec:do-laccoliths-stop}

The dimensionless thickness  $h_0$ as a function  of its dimensionless
radius $R$  for a current  that solidifies in  the third phase  of the
bending   regime    can   be    derived   from   the    scaling   laws
(\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco})  and  (\ref{C3-ScalingR-Visco})  and  should
follow
\begin{equation}
  h_0 = 0.3 h_f^{-1/7}\nu^{-2/7}R^{8/7}\label{C4-Hr}.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[h!]

      at Elba Island.   Substituting (\ref{C3-T1}) into (\ref{C3-Pe}),
      we obtain $Pe  = Q_0 H /(\pi \kappa  \Lambda^2)$; the parameters
      for calculating $Pe$ for each  laccolith are the same than those
      used for the  nondimensionalization, $\kappa=10^{-6}$ m s$^{-2}$
      and  $St_m$  is  considered  constant and  set  to  $0.5$.   The
      viscosity contrast is  set to $\nu =7.9\times  10^{-10}$ for all
      laccoliths.         Dotted        line:       scaling        law

    \label{C4-Data}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
Using the parameters listed in Figure \ref{C4-Data}, the dimensionless
observations show a very good agreement with the model for a viscosity
contrast      close      to      $8$     orders      of      magnitude
($\nu = 3.1\pm  1.0 \times 10^{-8}$, $r^2=0.92$),  which is consistent
with  the  felsic composition  of  these  laccoliths, and  $h_f=0.005$
(Figure \ref{C4-Data} a) \citep{Marsh:1981dc,Diniega:2013eh}.  Varying
$h_f$ has only  a minor effect on the best  fit viscosity contrast and
is discussed in Appendix  \ref{sec:phase-diagram}.  This value for the
viscosity contrast also depends on  the chosen value for the intrusion
parameters, i.e. on the height  scale $H$ whose main uncertainties are
on  the liquidus  viscosity  $\eta_h$ and  the  injection rate  $Q_0$.
Indeed, the larger these two  parameters, the larger the height scale,
the smaller  the dimensionless thicknesses and  therefore, the smaller
the best fit viscosity contrast.

Nevertheless, introducing the cooling  allows the model predictions to
reconciliate with the observations in  the case of laccoliths (Chapter
\ref{chap2}).  The shape and in particular, the large thickness of the
laccoliths at  Elba Island is  now entirely consistent with  the model
predictions and therefore with their arrest in the bending regime.  In
the  following,  we   use  the  phase  diagram   proposed  in  Section
\ref{C4-sec:evol-with-bend} to better constrain the viscosity contrast
along with $\eta_h$ and $Q_0$.

\subsubsection*{What can we learn from the phase diagram?}

It  is generally  assumed  that  the magma  stops  spreading when  its
crystal   content  becomes   close  to   its  maximum   packing,  i.e.
$\phi  \sim  60\%$   \citep{Pinkerton:1992fwa}.   Beyond  this  point,
crystal collisions  dominate and  the viscosity  jumps to  much higher
values \citep{Lejeune:1995fc,Giordano:2008em}.  We assume that this is
equivalent to  $\eta_e$ tending to  $\eta_c$ in our model.   With this
assumption, the  model thus predicts  that a magmatic  intrusion would
solidify as  a laccolith  upon reaching the  third bending  phase; the
phase   diagram   proposed  in   Section   \ref{C4-sec:evol-with-bend}
simplifies (Figure \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).

It shows that sills and laccoliths are two specific end member regions
as a function of $Pe$ and  $\nu$. Given the felsic composition of Elba
island laccoliths,  this phase diagram  can then be used  to constrain
their Peclet  number, and  therefore $Q_0$ and  $\eta_h$, for  them to
fall in the laccolith region.  In  the following, we use this approach
to constrain the injection rate $Q_0$ for these laccoliths.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Subset  of   the  phase   diagram  proposed   in  Section
      \ref{C4-sec:evol-with-bend}   relevant   for    the   study   of
      terrestrial laccoliths. Red and purple crosses represent a range
      of  values for  $\nu$ and  $Pe$  for Elba  Island laccoliths  and
      low-slope lunar domes  respectively. The width of  each cross is
      defined by  the minimum and  the maximum value obtained  for the
      Peclet number given the range  of variation of parameters listed
      in  table  \ref{C4-tab},  the   injection  rate  $Q_0$  and  the
      viscosity at the liquidus  temperature $\eta_h$ indicated on the
      plot. The  height of  the cross corresponds  to the  minimum and
      maximum   values  for   the  viscosity   contrast  obtain   from
      (\ref{C4-Hr}) when $h_f=0.005$.}
    \label{C4-PhaseDiag}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

We first compute  a value for the Peclet number  for each laccolith at
Elba  Island. Injecting  the scales  (\ref{C3-L1}), (\ref{C3-H1})  and
(\ref{C3-T1}) in the expression of $Pe$ (\ref{C3-Pe}) gives
\begin{equation}
  Pe \approx 1.5 Q_{0}^{5/4}\eta_{h}^{1/4}\rho_m^{1/4}g^{1/4}E^{-1/2} d_0^{-3/2} \kappa_m^{-1}
\end{equation}
where we  set the  Poisson's ratio to  $\nu^*=0.25$. Except  for $Q_0$
,that we want  to constrain, and $d_0$, which is  given and depends on
the  laccolith,  we  take  the   parameter  values  listed  in  Figure
\ref{C4-Data}.  Therefore, $Pe$ reads
\begin{equation}
  Pe \approx 5.9\times10^4 d_0^{-3/2} Q_0^{5/4}
  \label{PeExpre}
\end{equation}
For $St_m  =0.5$, the intrusion depths  given by \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}
and  $Q_0 =10$  m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$,  the modified  Peclet number  $Pe_m$
ranges from  $1$ to  $4$.  As  the best  fit range  of values  for the
viscosity  contrast  associated  with  $Q_0=10$  m$^{3}$  s$^{-1}$  is
$\nu  = 3.1\pm  1.0  \times  10^{-8}$, as  discussed  in the  previous
Section, the phase diagram thus  predicts that these laccoliths should
have stopped in the gravity regime (Figure \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}). Hence,
we  might have  overestimated the  injection rate.   Indeed, taking  a
smaller value  for the injection  rate of $Q_0=0.1$  m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$,
reasonable for viscous felsic magmas \citep{Harris:2000jd}, the height
scale $H$  is smaller  and the  dimensionless thicknesses  are larger.
The    model   thus    predicts    a    larger   viscosity    contrast
$\nu=5.5\pm1.8\times  10^{-10}$, still  consistent with  the range  of
expected values for felsic magmas,  and weaker Peclet numbers.  In the
end,  the range  of values  for  the dimensionless  numbers now  falls
within the  laccolith region and  is consistent with  the observations
(Figure \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).

\subsubsection*{Do  laccoliths really  stop  upon  reaching the  third
  bending phase?}

If the laccoliths stopped spreading as  soon as they reached the third
phase of the  bending regime, the variance in thickness  and radius in
between  the   different  intrusions  should  also   be  explained  by
variations  in the  Peclet number,  most likely  due to  variations in
intrusion  depths  in  this   example.   Indeed,  the  time  $t_{b3}$,
necessary  to reach  the third  bending phase,  the thickness  and the
radius  of the  current at  this time  all depend  on the  combination
($\nu$,$Pe_m$) considered (see Section \ref{C4-sec:evol-with-bend}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Visco_PE_Heating.eps}
    \caption{a)  Dimensionless thickness  at the  center $h_0$  versus
      dimensionless radius $R$ for different sets $(\nu,Pe)$ indicated
      on  the plot  ($\eta(\theta)=\eta_2$, $\Omega=1.0$).   Pentagons
      refer to the  size where the effective viscosity  of the current

      $\eta_e=0.7\eta_c$.   b)   Dimensionless  thickness  $\hat{h_0}$

      $h_f=0.005$.  As  expected, after  rescaling $h_0$ and  $R$, the
      sizes of the solidified laccoliths should collapse almost on the
      same point. }
    \label{C4-Visco_PE_Heating}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


To test  this hypothesis,  we first  rescale the  time using  the time
$t_{b3}$ (\ref{C4-tb3}) as follows
\begin{equation}
  \hat{t}= h_f^{4/17} Pe_m^{-11/17}\nu^{8/17}t,
  \label{C4-tRescale}
\end{equation}
where  $\hat{t}$ is  the new  variable. Injecting  (\ref{C4-tRescale})
into (\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco}) and  (\ref{C3-ScalingR-Visco}), we find
that the corresponding thickness $\hat{h_0}$ and radius $\hat{R}$ read
\begin{eqnarray}
  \hat{h_0}&=& h_f^{3/17}Pe_m^{-4/17}\nu^{6/17}h_0,\label{Hath0}\\
  \hat{R}&=& h_f^{1/34}Pe_m^{-7/34}\nu^{1/17}R.\label{HatR}
\end{eqnarray}
In terms of  $\hat{h_0}$ and $\hat{R}$, the  scaling law (\ref{C4-Hr})
rewrites $ \hat{h_0} \sim 0.3\hat{R}^{8/7}$ and does not depend on the
dimensionless numbers anymore  (Figure \ref{C4-Visco_PE_Heating}). For
laccoliths at Elba Island, we  use a constant viscosity contrast equal
to  $\nu =  5.5\cdot 10^{-10}$,  $h_f=0.005$ and  we compute  a Peclet
number for each laccolith  according to (\ref{PeExpre}) with $Q_0=0.1$
m$^3$ $s^{-1}$ and its reported intrusion depth.  

However,  the different  laccoliths do  not collapse  on the  same dot
after  rescaling   (Figure  \ref{C4-Data}  b).   In   particular,  the
dependence in $Pe$ of our  scaling, resulting from different intrusion
depths,  is not  enough  to explain  the variability  in  the size  of
terrestrial laccoliths.  Assuming that  they indeed stop upon reaching
the third  bending phase, an additional  cooling mechanism, amplifying
the effect of  $Pe$, is required to explain the  exact extent of these
laccoliths.  This could be extraction  of heat by circulation of fluid
\citep{Senger:2014tt}.   To  test  this  hypothesis, we  look  at  the
low-slope domes on  the Moon where conduction is most  likely the only
source of cooling.

\subsection{Low-slope lunar domes}
\label{sec:appl-arrest-terr-1}

Because the Moon is supposed  to be depleted of volatiles, circulation
of fluid in the lunar crust is likely to be very limited and the model
developed  in this  Chapter  should be  appropriate  for studying  the
cooling of  low-slope lunar domes.   In this Section, we  restrict our
analysis  to  some  specific  domes whose  characteristics  have  been
precisely   revisited  by   Mélanie   Thiriet   (Purple  dots   Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie},   see  Section   \ref{C2-sec:observ-vs-pred}).
Their  shapes  and  characteristics  have already  been  discussed  in
Chapter \ref{chap2} and  hereafter, we look at their  dimension in the
light of the cooling elastic-plated gravity current model.

\subsubsection*{Range of values for the dimensionless numbers}
\label{C4-sec:range-valu-dimens-gr}

Parameters  for  a  lunar  setting  have  been  discussed  in  Chapter
\ref{chap2} and are summarized  in Table \ref{C4-tab}.  In particular,
for the  same injection rate,  the smaller gravity, together  with the
higher  density and  the smaller  viscosity of  lunar magmas,  lead to
smaller Peclet numbers.  For instance, for an intrusion $1.5$ km deep,
using  $g=1.62$  m s$^{-2}$,  $\eta_h=1$  Pa  s and  $\rho_m=2900$  kg
m$^{-3}$  instead  of $g=9.81$  m  s$^{-2}$,  $\eta_h=10^6$ Pa  s  and
$\rho_m=2500$  kg m$^{-3}$  leads  to  a Peclet  number  two orders  of
magnitude  smaller on  the Moon  than  on Earth,  i.e.  $Pe=0.04$  and
$Pe=3.6$ respectively.  

However, injection  rates on the  Moon might  be larger than  on Earth
\citep{Crisp:1990gf,Zimbelman:1998ww}           (See           Section
\ref{C2-sec:observ-vs-pred}).  For an injection rate one to two orders
of magnitude larger  and $d$ between $0.5$ and $1.5$  km, the range of
Peclet number is in fact very similar, i.e.  from $10^{-3}$ to $10^4$.
Therefore,  taking  $St_m=0.1$, we  have  $Pe_m$  that varies  between
$0.01$ and $10^5$  for low-slope lunar domes.   Finally, lunar basalts
are mafic in composition and  the viscosity contrast $\nu$ should vary
between $10^{-3}$ and $10^{-5}$ \citep{Diniega:2013eh}.

\subsubsection*{Constraining the magma physical properties}
\label{C4-sec:constr-magma-phys}

For  an  injection  rate  of $Q_0=10$  m$^{3}$  s$^{-1}$,  a  liquidus
viscosity of  $\eta_h= 1$  Pa s  and the  parameters listed  in Figure
\ref{C4-Data},  the dimensionless  thicknesses of  these domes  are also
consistent with  a viscosity  contrast close  to $10^{-8}$  (best fit:
$\nu=7.9 \pm 1.8 \times 10^{-9}$) (Figure \ref{C4-Data}).  

On the Moon, (\ref{PeExpre}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  Pe \approx 125 d_0^{-3/2} Q_0^{5/4}\eta_h^{1/4},
  \label{PeExpreMoon}
\end{equation}
and assuming that  the intrusion depth ranges from $500$  m to $5$ km,
the Peclet  number ranges from  $0.005$ to $0.2$ and,  for $St_m=0.5$,
the range  of values for the  dimensionless numbers thus falls  at the
boundary  between  the  two  domains  in  the  phase  diagram  (Figure
\ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).  It is consistent with  the radius of these lunar
domes being close to $R=4$, i.e.   close to the transition radius with
the gravity regime (Figure \ref{C4-Data}).  

However, the estimate  for the viscosity contrast is  much larger than
the  value  expected  for  their  mafic  composition.   For  the  same
injection rate and  a ``hot'' viscosity $\eta_h=10^3$ Pa  s instead of
$\eta_h=1$ Pa s, the height scale  $H$ is larger and the dimensionless
thicknesses smaller.  The best  fit viscosity contrast  is now  close to
$10^{-5}$ ($\nu = 3.3 \pm  0.8 \times10^{-6}$), closer to the expected
value,   and  the   Peclet   numbers  are   slightly  larger   (Figure
\ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).  

A  similar  value for  the  viscosity  contrast  can be  obtained  for
$\eta_h=1$ Pa s and $Q_0=3000$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$.  However, in that case,
the Peclet  numbers are much  larger and the  range of values  for the
dimensionless   numbers  falls   within   the   sill  region   (Figure
\ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).

In the end, it suggests that the injection rates for these lunar domes
were smaller than $10$ m$^{3}$  s$^{-1}$, and hence, several orders of
magnitude smaller  than the effusion  rates estimated from  the runout
distances of  some lava flows in  the lunar maria i.e.   $Q_0\ge 10^6$
m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ \citep{TracyKPGregg:1996wp}.

\subsubsection{Is conductive  cooling enough to solidify  a laccolith
  on the Moon?}
\label{C4-sec:cond-cool-enough}

On the  Moon, the dimensionless sizes  of the domes vary  by less than
one order of  magnitude and might be explained only  by the conductive
cooling  of the  magmatic intrusion  (Figure \ref{C4-Data}).   Because
intrusion depths are not known for  these domes, we can not process as
for Elba Island laccoliths to test this hypothesis.

Instead, we estimate  a range of intrusion depths that  would produce a
collapse of  the rescaled size of  the domes on a  reference dome size
given by $\hat{R^{\text{ref}}}$ and $\hat{h_0^{\text{ref}}}$.  Indeed,
using (\ref{HatR}), $\hat{R}=\hat{R}^{\text{ref}}$ implies that
\begin{equation}
  \Lambda^{-1}h_f^{1/34}Pe_m^{-7/34}\nu^{1/17}R =   \left(\Lambda^{\text{ref}}\right)^{-1}\left(h_f^{\text{ref}}\right)^{1/34}\left(Pe_m^{\text{ref}}\right)^{-7/34}\left(\nu^{\text{ref}}\right)^{1/17}R^{\text{ref}},\label{RefDome1}
\end{equation}
where the topscript ref denotes a reference dome and the radii $R$ and
$R^{\text{ref}}$ are with dimension. Assuming that the different lunar
domes  differ   only  by   their  intrusion   depth,  (\ref{RefDome1})
simplifies and reads
\begin{equation}
  d_0 = \left(R/R^{\text{ref}}\right)^{34/15}d_0^{\text{ref}}.
  \label{C4-dd}
\end{equation}
We take the  largest dome as a  reference and we set its  depth to the
largest reasonable value, i.e.  $d_0=5$  km, mainly to ensure that the
dimensionless  radius of  the other  domes remains  smaller than  $4$.
Injecting the dome radii in  (\ref{C4-dd}) then gives intrusion depths
between $0.5$ km  and $5$ km and Peclet numbers  between $10^{-2}$ and
$0.5$, consistent with their expected values.

      scale  $\Lambda$ (\ref{C3-L1})  and thickness  $H$ (\ref{C3-H1})

    \label{C4-ArrestMoon}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
However, while these new parameters result in the collapse of $\hat{R}$
for  the different  domes,  the  variation in  Peclet  number can  not
account   for  the   dispersion  in   the  dome   thicknesses  (Figure
\ref{C4-ArrestMoon}).  In  addition, the dimensionless thickness  as a
function of the  dimensionless radius does not follow  the scaling law
(\ref{C4-Hr})   anymore   (Figure  \ref{C4-ArrestMoon}).    The   same
conclusion is obtained  using different reference domes  or by setting
the constraint on  the rescaled thickness instead of  the radius, i.e.
$\hat{h_0}=\hat{h_0^{\text{ref}}}$.

\subsection{What causes the arrest of terrestrial laccoliths?}
\label{C4-sec:what-causes-arrest}

Together,  Elba Island  laccoliths and  low-slope lunar  domes suggest
that the highly  viscous region, which composed the tip  region at the
beginning  of  the third  bending  phase,  does not  stop  terrestrial
laccoliths  as suggested  initially.  Indeed,  the data  support their
later arrest during the third bending phase. Alternatively, we propose
that the injection  rate is responsible for the  arrest of terrestrial
laccoliths.

Indeed,  in reality,  one  may expect  that the  flow  rate, which  is
considered constant in this model, wanes as the deep magma source gets
exhausted \citep{Taisne:2009va,Rivalta:2010em}.  In  this case, only a
fixed volume of  magma is available, which may control  the final size
of the magmatic intrusion.

\citet{Michaut:2011kg} also suggests  that the weight of  the magma at
the center might compensate the  initial overpressure $\Delta P$; when
$\Delta P/(\rho_m  g H)=h_0$ the  flow is thick enough  to accommodate
the  overpressure below  and enters  a regime  of lateral  propagation
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}. The associated pressure drop combined with the
cooling could be enough to  prevent lateral spreading and solidify a
laccolith.  For  the smaller overpressure  $\Delta P$ and  the typical
parameters  listed  in  Table  \ref{C4-tab}, this  would  happen  when
$h_0\sim 200$,  which can  be reached for  $\nu<10^{-6}$ in  the third
bending regime.

Alternatively, the intrusion could also grow by the mean of multiple,
yet  quickly  coalescing  pulses,  i.e. several  bursts  separated  by
sufficiently short rest periods such that a melted cored is maintained
at the  center of  the flow.   This is  suggested by  numerous shallow
intermediate       scale       intrusion      geological       studies
\citep{Habert:2004wg,Horsman:2005ct,Morgan:2008hj,Leuthold:2012gja,Roni:2014gt}.
In that  case, the tip of  the intrusion would likely  be ``cold'' for
subsequent injections.   Hence, the final laccolith  morphology, while
following  the ``cold''  viscosity  scaling  law (\ref{C4-Hr}),  would
exhibit a  somewhat random position  on this scaling law  depending on
its feeding history.


\subsection{Large mafic sills}
\label{C4-sec:large-mafic-sill}

As we  discussed in  Chapter \ref{chap2}, the  thickness of  the large
mafic  sills  reported  by   \citet{Cruden:tg}  increases  with  their
diameter. This trend is apparently  in contradiction with the constant
thickness  predicted  by  the  elastic-plated  gravity  current  model
(Figure \ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}).  

One possible explanation is that  different sills are characterized by
different injection rates, i.e.   by different height scales.  Forcing
the  dimensionless  thicknesses  of  different sills  to  be  constant
imposes that
\begin{equation}
  Q_0 = (h_0/h_0^{\text{ref}})^4Q_0^{\text{ref}},
\end{equation}
where $h_0$ is the sill  thickness with dimension, $Q_0$ its injection
rate  and  $h_0^{\text{ref}}$  and  $Q_0^{\text{ref}}$  are  reference
values for these parameters.  Taking  the thickest sill as a reference
with $Q_0^{\text{ref}} =  10^4$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$, we find  that in order
to collapse all  the data on a constant thickness,  the injection rate
have  to  vary by  at  least  $7$  orders  of magnitude,  i.e.   from
$Q_0=10^{-3}$ to $Q_0= 10^{4}$ m$^3$  s$^{-1}$. It is much larger than
the expected range  of variation for this parameter  and hence, these
mafic  sills do  not appear  to  have all  stop in  the third  gravity
regime.

Another possible explanation is that  fracturation at the tip, instead
of cooling, have triggered the  arrest of these magmatic intrusions in
the  second   gravity  phase.   Indeed,  while   fracturation  is  not
sufficient  to stop  a magmatic  intrusion in  the bending  regime, it
might   be  responsible   for  the   arrest  of   large  mafic   sills
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}.  The increasing  thickness with diameter would
thus be consistent with the  thickness increase induced by the cooling
of the sill in the second gravity phase.

Alternatively, the  solidification of the  sill in the  second gravity
regime could follow  the decline of the injection rate  before it gets
to the third gravity regime.  Indeed, maintaining a constant injection
over the  period required to reach  the third gravity phase,  which is
enhanced by the insulation of the wall rock, might be unrealistic. For
instance,  even for  a constant  injection rate  of $Q_0\sim  1$ m$^3$
s$^{-1}$ and typical parameters for mafic sills, the time to reach the
third gravity regime $t_{g3}$ is close to $10$ k.y.

In both  cases, the slope  of $h_0(R)$ exhibits  by the data  could be
linked to  the slope shown  by the  simulations in the  second gravity
regime. However,  more information about  the intrusion depths  and the
relationship between the different sill  units, which are not given by
\citet{Cruden:tg},   would  be   required  to   precisely  test   this
hypothesis.

\subsection{Contact aureole}
\label{C4-sec:thermal-aureol}

Contact  metamorphism  often  occurs   in  the  vicinity  of  magmatic
intrusions
\citep{Jaeger:1959du,SILLITOE:1998bs,Senger:2014tt}. Metamorphism is a
complex process and in the following, we discuss only the dimension of
the thermal aureole  in the vicinity of laccoliths  which have stopped
in the third bending regime.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.42]{Contact_Aureole_Pe1.eps}
    \caption{a)  Snapshot  of  the  flow thermal  structure  with  its
      surrounding  thermal   aureole  at   $t=10$  for   $Pe=1.0$  and
      $\nu=10^{-3}$.  Isotherms  are indicated  on the plot.   b) Same
      plot but for $Pe=10.0$.}
    \label{Contact_Areuol2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

We define the thickness of the  thermal aureole $L_h(t)$ by the region
where  $\Theta_r>0.1$  above  the  center  of  the  flow.   Therefore,
inverting (\ref{C4-eq11}) gives $L_h(t)$, the maximum thickness of the
thermal aureole above the intrusion at $r=0$
\begin{equation}
  L_h(t)                                                           =
  \erf^{-1}\left(\frac{0.1}{\Theta_s(r=0,t)}\right)2Pe^{-1/2}t^{1/2}.
  \label{Aureol}
\end{equation}
$L_h$ scales as  $Pe^{-1/2}$ and hence, is larger for  small values of
$Pe$ (Figure \ref{Contact_Areuol2}). Indeed, for large $Pe$, advection
dominates on  the emplacement  time scale and  the thermal  aureole is
restricted   to   a   small    zone   around   the   current   (Figure
\ref{Contact_Areuol2}).  For  instance, the  thickness of  the contact
aureole $L_h(t)$  at $t=10$ is  almost equal to the  current thickness
$h_0$  for $Pe=1$  whereas  it is  only  a few  percent  of $h_0$  for
$Pe=10.0$ (Figure \ref{Contact_Areuol2}).
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.43]{ThermalAureol_50Point_2figure_R4.eps}
    \caption{a)  Maximum  Size  of   the  thermal  aureole  above  the
      intrusion   $L_h^{\text{max}}$  normalized   by  the   intrusion

      function of the  number $Pe$ and $\nu$.  b) Same  plot but where
      the thermal  aureole is  defined with $\Theta_r=0.8$  instead of
      $0.1$ in (\ref{Aureol3}).  In both  plot, we set $h_f=0.005$ and
      $\Theta_s(r=0,t_{t})=1$.}
    \label{PhaseHeatingContact}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The dimension of  the thermal aureole also depends  on the emplacement
time $t$;  the longer the  injection, the  longer the heating  and the
larger the thermal aureole. An upper limit for the emplacement time of
laccoliths is given by the time  $t_t$ for the intrusion to transition
in the  gravity regime while it  is in the third  bending regime, i.e.
$t_t=6.5\nu^{-2/7}h_f^{-1/7}$               (See               Section
\ref{C3-sec:diff-evol-with-1}).   Injecting $t_t$  into (\ref{Aureol})
gives
\begin{equation}
  L_h^{\text{max}}                                                           =5.0  \erf^{-1}\left(\frac{0.1}{\Theta_s(r=0,t_{t})}\right)h_f^{-1/14}\nu^{-1/7}Pe^{-1/2},
  \label{Aureol2}
\end{equation}
and therefore, using (\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco}), we get
\begin{equation}
  L_h^{\text{max}}/h_0(t_t)                                                           =3.7
  \erf^{-1}\left(\frac{0.1}{\Theta_s(r=0,t_{t})}\right)h_f^{1/14}\nu^{1/7}Pe^{-1/2}.
  \label{Aureol3}
\end{equation}
While  the absolute  size  of the  thermal aureole  $L^{\text{max}}_h$
increases with  decreasing $Pe$  and $\nu$ (\ref{Aureol2}),  the ratio
$L_h^{\text{max}}/h_0$  is  smaller  for  larger  viscosity  contrasts
(Figure \ref{PhaseHeatingContact}).

For   the   felsic   laccoliths   at   Elba   Island,   we   estimated
$\nu \sim  10^{-9}$ and  $Pe\sim 10^{-3}$  (Figure \ref{C4-PhaseDiag})
and thus,  the thermal aureole  should reach $400\%$ of  the intrusion
thickness at the center  of the flow (Figure \ref{PhaseHeatingContact}
a).  Important temperature  variations  however, i.e.  $\Theta_r>0.8$,
should be restricted to the vicinity of the current, i.e.  $\sim 60\%$
of  the  intrusion  thickness  (Figure  \ref{PhaseHeatingContact}  b).
Theses  estimates represent  upper  bound as  the  temperature at  the
surface $\Theta_s(r=0,t)$ might be smaller  than $1$ for $Pe<0.1$.  In
addition,   the  model   neither  accounts   for  horizontal   thermal
conduction,  nor for  circulation of  fluid  in the  wall rocks,  both
effects that should also limit the size of the thermal aureole.


\section{Summary and discussion}
\label{C4-sec:discussion}

In this Chapter, we discuss a more realistic model for the emplacement
of magmatic intrusions in the shallow crust of terrestrial planets. In
particular, we  describe the dynamics  of a magma characterized  by an
Arrhenius rheology and heating the wall rocks as it spreads.

We show  that relaxing  the thermal  boundary condition  insulates the
flow and  therefore, allows  the intrusion  to stay  hot for  a longer
period.  In particular,  the thermal anomaly detaches  slower from the
tip of the  intrusion.  It also does not reach  a steady state anymore
in  the  gravity regime  as  the  heating  of the  surrounding  medium
constantly    decreases    the    heat    loss    in    the    central
region. Nevertheless,  the Arrhenius rheology largely  compensates for
the delay in the transitions induced by the heating of the surrounding
medium.  In the end, except for  the third phase in both regimes which
is reached slightly later, the dynamics shows only small variations in
comparison to the one described in Chapter \ref{C3-JFM}.

During the bending  regime, the local thermal condition at  the tip of
the current  governs the  effective flow viscosity.   As the  fluid is
cooling by conduction,  the thermal anomaly detaches from  the tip and
the flow effective  viscosity rapidly increases to  stabilize when the
front  becomes entirely  ``cold''.  Nevertheless,  the formation  of a
highly viscous  region at  the front of  the intrusion,  and therefore
cooling, is  probably not  responsible for  the arrest  of terrestrial
laccoliths. Instead of  a rigid plug arresting the  intrusion, the tip
region might thus better represent a highly viscous region controlling
the expansion of the flow.

Alternatively,  we propose  that the  injection rate  is the  limiting
factor in the growth of these magmatic intrusions in the third bending
phase.

Available data for large mafic sills on Earth show less agreement with
the model  predictions.  Indeed, we  show that sills should  behave as
``cold'' isoviscous gravity current when  the thermal anomaly is small
compared  to  the  flow  itself,  i.e.   in  similar  settings,  their
thickness should tend  to a constant.  The increase  in thickness with
diameter recorded  in the  data might thus  suggest that  they instead
stop in the second gravity phase.

In the  end, while the  cooling appears  as an important  mechanism to
understand the morphology of shallow magmatic intrusions, it might not
be responsible for their arrest.   We discuss some possible extensions
of this work in the last part of this manuscript.

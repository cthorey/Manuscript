\chapter{Toward  a more  realistic model  and its  application to  the
  spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions}
\label{Heating}

\minitoc The previous Chapter was  first step toward the understanding
how  the  cooling  of  the  laccolith  interacts  with  its  dynamics.
Hereafter,  we first  investigate the  changes triggered  by both  the
heating of  the surrounding  layer and a  more realistic  rheology. We
then compare the  model prediction with the  observations presented in
chapter \ref{chap2}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{C4-sec:introduction}
 
Contact metamorphism around sill intrusion is a common process

\citep{Everett:2008tn}

\section{Theory}
\label{C4-sec:theory-1}

We  consider   the  model  of  elastic-plated   gravity  current  with
temperature-dependent      viscosity     described      in     Section
\ref{C3-sec:theory}   where   we   relax   the   isothermal   boundary
condition. In the following, we specify  only the change in the theory
that comes  with the new thermal  boundary condition and we  refer the
reader  to  Section \ref{C3-sec:theory}  for  more  details about  the
derivation.

\subsection{Thermal boundary condition}
\label{C4-sec:formulation-1}

We now  consider the heating  of the  surrounding medium by  the magma
itself at the contact with the surrounding rock, the continuity of the
temperature imposes to rewrite the vertical temperature profile as
\begin{equation}
  T=
  \begin{cases}
    T_b - (T_b-T_s)(1-\frac{z}{\delta})^2 & 0 \le z\le \delta \\
    T_b & \delta \le z\le h-\delta \\
    T_b - (T_b-T_s)(1-\frac{h-z}{\delta})^2 & h-\delta \le z\le h\\
  \end{cases}
  \label{C4-Temperature}
\end{equation}
where  $\delta(r,t)$   is  the   thermal  boundary   layer  thickness,
$T(r,z,t)$ is temperature of the  fluid, $T_b(r,t)$ is the temperature
at the center of the profile  and $T_s(r,t)$ is the temperature of the
surface,  i.e.    $T(r,z=0,t)=T(r,z=h,t)=T_s(r,t)$.   As   in  Section
\ref{C3-sec:theory},  this  profile  assures  the  continuity  of  the
temperature and heat flux within  the flow. In addition, continuity of
the heat flux across the flow boundaries reads
\begin{eqnarray}
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                    T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=0}&=&k_r\left.\frac{\partial              T_r}{\partial
                     z}\right|_{z=0}  \label{C4-Flux1}\\
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                  T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=h}&=&k_r\left.\frac{\partial            T_r}{\partial
                     z}\right|_{z=h}
                     \label{C4-Flux2}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $T_r(r,z)$ is  the temperature  in the  surrounding medium  and
$k_r$ its  thermal conductivity.  Assuming  a semi infinite  layer for
the rigid layer below  the intrusion, \citet{Carslaw:1959wf} show that
the temperature $T_r$ in the  surrounding rocks can be approximated to
a first order by
\begin{equation}
  T_r(r,z,t)-T_0=(T_{s}-T_0)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(\frac{-z}{2\sqrt{\kappa_r t}}\right)}.
  \label{C4-eq22}
\end{equation}
The  thickness of  the upper  layer is  equal to  the intrusion  depth
$d_c$. However,  we assume that the  depth $d_c$ is large  compared to
the characteristic  length scale for  conduction $L_c$ and we  use the
same approximation to derive $T_r$ above the intrusion
\begin{equation}
  T_r(r,z,t)-T_0=(T_{s}-T_0)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(\frac{z-h}{2\sqrt{\kappa_r t}}\right)}.
  \label{C4-eq11}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the  two thermal  boundary conditions  (\ref{C4-Flux1}) and
(\ref{C4-Flux2}) become
\begin{eqnarray}
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                    T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=0}&=& k_r
                     \frac{T_{s}-T_{0}}{\sqrt{\pi \kappa_r t}}  \label{C4-2Flux_1}\\
  k_m\left.\frac{\partial                                    T}{\partial
  z}\right|_{z=h}&=& -k_r
                     \frac{T_{s}-T_{0}}{\sqrt{\pi \kappa_r t}}.
                     \label{C4-2Flux_2}
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection{Dimensionless equations}
\label{C4-sec:dimens-equat-1}

Except  for   the  conduction  term,   which  now  accounts   for  the
dimensionless  surface temperature  $\Theta_s$, the  coupled equations
governing the  cooling the current  are very similar  to (\ref{C3-HF})
and (\ref{C3-TF}) and reads
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}-\frac{12}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial      r}
  \left( r I_1(h) \frac{\partial P}{\partial
  r}\right)
  \label{C4-HF}
  & =& \mathcal{H}(\frac{\gamma}{2}-r)\frac{32}{\gamma^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{r^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}\right)\\
  \frac{\partial                                       \xi}{\partial
  t}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial                          r}
  \left( r\left(\bar{u}\xi-\Sigma\right)\right)&=&2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{\delta}\label{C4-TF}
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  \overline{\theta}&=&\frac{1}{3}\left(2\Theta_b+\Theta_s\right)\label{C4-tbar}\\
  \overline{u}&=&\frac{12}{\delta}
                  \frac{\partial
                  P}{\partial
                  r}\left(\delta
                  I_0(\delta)-I_1(\delta)\right)\\
  \Sigma &=& \frac{12}{\delta} \frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\left(I_0(\delta)\left(G(\delta)-\delta\overline{\theta}\right)+\overline{\theta}I_1(\delta)-I_2(\delta)\right).
\end{eqnarray}
where $G(z)$ denotes  a primitive of $\theta(z)$  when $z<\delta$. The
rheology, which  couples equations (\ref{C4-HF}) and  (\ref{C4-TF}) is
contained in the  three integrals $I_0(z)$, $I_1(z)$  and $I_2(z)$ and
is discussed  in the  next section.   The thermal  boundary conditions
(\ref{C4-2Flux_1})  and (\ref{C4-2Flux_2})  reduce in  a dimensionless
form to
\begin{equation}
  2\frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{\delta}               =               \Omega
  Pe^{1/2}\frac{\Theta_s}{\sqrt{\pi t}}.
  \label{C4-Boundary-Condi}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is a new dimensionless number; it is equal to
\begin{equation}
  \Omega=\frac{k_r}{k_m}\left(\frac{\kappa_m}{\kappa_r}\right)^{1/2}\label{C4-omega}
\end{equation}
and represents the  ratio between heat conduction at  the contact with
the encasing rocks and heat diffusion within the fluid.

Finally,      using      this     thermal      boundary      condition
(\ref{C4-Boundary-Condi}), we  can show  that the  different variables
can   be   expressed   in   term  of   $\xi$   such   that   (Appendix
\ref{C4-Heat:AppendixA})
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_s(r,t)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{3 \beta}{4} \xi - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \sqrt{\beta \xi \left(3 \beta \xi + 8\right)} + 1 & \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \\
    \frac{- 12  \xi +  6 h{\left  (r,t \right  )}}{\left(\beta h{\left
            (r,t  \right  )} +  6\right)  h{\left  (r,t \right  )}}  &
    \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi > \xi_t
  \end{cases}
  \label{C4-TS}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_b(r)=
  \begin{cases}
    1 &\text{if } \hspace{1cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \\
    \frac{\Theta_{s}}{4}  \left(\beta(t)  h{\left  (r,t  \right  )}  +
      4\right) & \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi > \xi_t
  \end{cases}
  \label{C4-TB}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \delta(r)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{\Theta_{s} \beta(t)} \left(- 2 \Theta_{s} + 2\right) &\text{if } \hspace{1cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \\
    h(r,t)/2 & \text{if} \hspace{1cm} \xi > \xi_t
  \end{cases}
  \label{C4-DELTA}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  \xi_t(t)&=&\frac{\beta(t) h^{2}{\left (r,t \right )}}{6 \beta(t) h{\left (r,t \right )}
              + 24}\\
  \beta(t) &=& \Omega Pe^{1/2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi t}}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Rheology}
\label{C4-sec:rheology}

The model derived in  Section \ref{C4-sec:dimens-equat-1} does not yet
assume a specific  relation between viscosity and  temperature and the
choice  of the  rheology  $\eta(T)$, which  appears  in the  integrals
$I_0(z)$, $I_1(z)$  and $I_2(z)$  remains to  be defined.   In Section
\ref{C3-sec:theory}, we assume a  viscosity inversely dependent on the
temperature which reads in a dimensional form
\begin{equation}
  \eta(T)=\frac{\eta_h
    \eta_c(T_i-T_0)}{\eta_h(T_i-T_0)+(\eta_c-\eta_h)(T-T_0)}.
\end{equation}
where $\eta_h$  and $\eta_c$  are the viscosities  of the  hottest and
coldest  fluid  at  the   temperature  $T_i$  and  $T_0$  respectively
\citep{Bercovici:2007vc}.   While  this   model  possesses  some  nice
simplification properties, it  restricts the change in  viscosity to a
very narrow  range of  temperature close  to $T=T_0$,  i.e. $\theta=0$
(Figure   \ref{C4-Rheology}).   In   contrast,  the   Arrhenius  model
($\eta \sim  \exp(-k/T)$), which is  a more realistic model  to relate
temperature and viscosity of lavas \citep{Blatt:2ViMWPc0}, describes a
viscosity  that increases  over  a much  larger  range of  temperature
(Figure \ref{C4-Rheology}).  To get some insights into the effect of a
more  realistic temperature-dependent  viscosity, we  thus also  use a
first-order approximation of the Arrhenius  model as a second rheology
$\eta_2(T)$ \citep{Diniega:2013eh}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta_2(T)                          =                          \eta_h
  \exp\left(-\log\left(\frac{\eta_h}{\eta_c}\right)\left(1-\frac{T-T_0}{T_i-T_0}\right)\right)
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{Rheology.eps}
    \caption{Dimensionless viscosity  versus dimensionless temperature
      for  both  rheology   $\eta_1$  (\ref{C4-rheo-1})  and  $\eta_2$
      (\ref{C4-rheo-2}).}
    \label{C4-Rheology}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
In a dimensionless form, they read
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta_1(\theta)/\eta_h&=&\frac{1}{\nu+(1-\nu)\theta} \label{C4-rheo-1}\\
  \eta_2(\theta)/\eta_h&=&\exp\left(-\log(\nu)\left(1-\theta\right)\right)  \label{C4-rheo-2}
\end{eqnarray}
where   $\nu$  is   the  viscosity   contrast  described   in  Section
\ref{C3-sec:theory} and represents the ratio between the hot viscosity
$\eta_h$  and   the  cold  viscosity  $\eta_c$.    The  expression  of
$I_0(\delta)$, $I_1(\delta)$, $I_1(h)$ and $I_2(\delta)$, necessary to
close  the model,  are given  in Appendix  \ref{C4-Heat:AppendixB} for
both rheologies.

\subsection{Comparison with the isothermal model}
\label{C4-sec:some-limits}

We showed that relaxing the isothermal boundary condition introduces a
new dimensionless number $\Omega$ which  controls how much heat can be
transferred    to   the    surrounding    rocks.     In   the    limit
$\Omega \rightarrow \infty$, the model should thus reduce to the model
described    in    Section    \ref{C3-sec:theory}.     Indeed,    when
$\Omega\rightarrow \infty$, the  coefficient $\beta\rightarrow \infty$
and then  $\xi_t\rightarrow h/6$ (Section  \ref{C3-sec:theory}).  When
$\xi<\xi_t$,  injecting  the  corresponding expression  of  $\Theta_s$
(\ref{C4-TS})   in   the    corresponding   expression   of   $\delta$
(\ref{C4-DELTA}) gives
\begin{equation}
  \delta =\frac{3 \beta \xi +\sqrt{3} \sqrt{\beta \xi (3 \beta \xi +8)}+8}{2 \beta }
\end{equation}
which  tends   to  $3\xi$  when  $\beta   \rightarrow  \infty$.   When
$\xi>\xi_t$,  injecting  the  corresponding expression  of  $\Theta_s$
(\ref{C4-TS})   in   the   corresponding  expression   of   $\Theta_b$
(\ref{C4-TB}) gives
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_b = \frac{3 (\beta  h+4) (h-2 \xi )}{2 h (\beta  h+6)}
\end{equation}
which tends  to $3/2-3\xi/h$ when $\beta  \rightarrow \infty$ (Section
\ref{C3-sec:theory}). Finally, taking the limit of $\Theta_s$ for both
$\xi>\xi_t$ and $\xi<\xi_t$ show that  $\Theta_s$ indeed tends to zero
when $\Omega\rightarrow \infty$.

For magmatic  intrusion, the thermal  parameters of the magma  and the
encasing  rocks are  close and  the dimensionless  number $\Omega$  is
close to  $1$. In the following,  we study the effect  of relaxing the
isothermal   boundary  condition   on   the   dynamics  by   comparing
$\Omega=10^5$ and  $\Omega = 1$  in both regimes separately.   We also
investigate  the effect  of  a  more realistic  rheology  on the  flow
dynamics.

\section{Evolution in the bending regime}
\label{C4-sec:evol-bend-regime-1}

We  follow the  same approach  as in  the previous  Chapter and  first
concentrate  on the  case in  which  only bending  contributes to  the
pressure.   The   governing  equations  are  thus   (\ref{C4-HF})  and
(\ref{C4-TF})  where $P  = \nabla_r^4h$.   For an  isothermal boundary
condition, we show that the dynamics  in the bending regime depends on
the average  viscosity of a small  region at the front  of the current
and can be divided into three phases. Hereafter, we first describe how
the thermal  boundary condition  influences the  timing for  the phase
transition  by looking  at  two values  for  the dimensionless  number
$\Omega$,     i.e.       $\Omega=1$     and      $\Omega=10^5$     and
$\eta(\theta)=\eta_1(\theta)$.   We  thus  investigate the  effect  of
changing the rheology.

      $\nu=0.001$. The thermal structure  in the surrounding medium is
      given  by  (\ref{C4-eq11}) and  reads  in  a dimensionless  form
      $\Theta_r(r,z,t)=\Theta_s(r,t)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(Pe^{1/2}\frac{\kappa_m}{\kappa_r}\frac{(z-h)}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)}$
      where the ratio $\kappa_m/\kappa_r$ is set to $1$.}

\end{figure}
\subsection{Relaxing  the   thermal  boundary  condition,   effect  of
  $\Omega$}
\label{C4-sec:infl-therm-bound}

As for the isothermal boundary  condition, the thermal boundary layers
first connect  at the front  and a region of  cold fluid forms  at the
current tip  for $\Omega = 1$  (Figure \ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating}).
However, in  that case, the  heating of the surrounding  medium limits
heat loss in the central region of the current and the thermal anomaly
extends  further into  the flow.   For instance,  for $\nu=0.001$  and
$Pe=1.0$, while the thermal anomaly extends over $50\%$ of the current
for $\Omega = 10^5$ at $t=10$, it extends over more than $75\%$ of the
flow for $\Omega=1$ (Figure \ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating}).

As for $\Omega=10^5$, the current  first behaves as an isoviscous flow
with hot viscosity, it then slows  down and thickens to finally behave
again  as  an   isoviscous  flow  but  with   cold  viscosity  (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).  As the current tip remains hot for a
longueur  period of  time,  the  transition to  the  second and  third
bending regime are however delayed relative to the case $\Omega= 10^5$
(Figure    \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).     For   instance,    for
$\nu=10^{-3}$  and  $Pe=1.0$,  while  the transitions  to  the  second
bending phase  already begins at $t\sim  10^{-6}$ for $\Omega=10^{5}$,
it  occurs  only  after  $t\sim 10^{-5}$  for  $\Omega=  1.0$  (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).

In addition, the second phase  of thickening show two different stages
for $\Omega =  1.0$ and $Pe=100.0$: a first stage  where the thickness
drastically increases and a second stage where it continues increasing
but   much  slower   (Figure  \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}).    This
transition, enhanced  by the new thermal  boundary condition, reflects
the detachment  of the  thermal anomaly and  is discussed  in Appendix
\ref{C4-Heat:AppendixC}.

\subsection{Considering   a  more   realistic   rheology,  effect   of
  $\eta(\theta)$}
\label{C4-sec:infl-therm-bound}


The first  order Arrhenius rheology $\eta_2(\theta)$  widens the range
of  temperature  over  which significant  viscosity  variation  occurs
(Figure \ref{C4-Rheology}), i.e.  $\sim80\%$  of the temperature range
against $\sim10\%$ for $\eta_1(\theta)$.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/Figure_Heating/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology.eps}
    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless time $t$ for  different sets $(\eta,Pe)$ indicated
      on      the      plot.        Dotted-line:      scaling      law
      $h_0=  0.7h_f^{-1/11}\nu^{-2/11}t^{8/22}$  for  $\nu  =  0.001$.
      Right: Dimensionless  radius $R$  versus dimensionless  time $t$
      for  the  same  sets   $(\eta,Pe)$.   Dotted-line:  scaling  law
      $R= 2.2h_f^{1/22}\nu^{1/11}t^{7/22}$ for $\nu=0.001$.}
    \label{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Therefore, the effective flow viscosity  starts to increase sooner and
the transition to  the second phase of the flow  in the bending regime
occurs   sooner   than   for  the   rheology   previously   considered
$\eta_1(\theta)$   (Figure  \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).    For
instance, for  $\nu=10^{-3}$ and $Pe=1.0$,  while the second  phase of
the   flow   starts   around   $t\sim  10^{-5}$   for   the   rheology
$\eta_1(\theta)$, it  starts around  $t\sim 10^{-6}$ for  the rheology
$\eta_2(\theta)$   (Figure   \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).    In
particular, the  change in rheology  almost compensates for  the delay
caused by the heating of  the surrounding medium, i.e.  the transition
time for the second bending phase for ($\eta_1(\theta)$,$\Omega=10^5$)
is  almost the  same  than  for ($\eta_2(\theta)$,$\Omega=1$)  (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}                                  and
\ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_Rheol_Boundary}).

\subsection{Characterization of the thermal anomaly}
\label{C4-sec:char-therm-anom}

As  in Chapter  \ref{C3-JFM},  we  quantify the  size  of the  thermal
anomaly  through   a  critical  thermal  radius   $R_c(t)$  where  the
temperature  at the  center of  the flow  $\Theta_b$ is  $1\%$ of  the
injection temperature,  i.e.  $\Theta_b(r=0)-\Theta_b(r=R_c)=0.99$. As
expected,  the thermal  anomaly is  larger when  relaxing the  thermal
boundary condition and changing the rheology $\eta(\theta)$ has almost
no        effect        on         its        evolution        (Figure
\ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_Rheol_Boundary}). In addition, the extent of the cold
fluid region $R(t)-R_c(t)$  is growing slightly slower  with time when
considering $\Omega=1$  in comparison to the  isothermal boundary case
$\Omega=10^5$   (Figure  \ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_Rheol_Boundary}).    In  the
following, we characterize  the thermal anomaly evolution  in the more
realistic case where $\Omega=1$ and $\eta(\theta)=\eta_2(\theta)$.

The size of the thermal anomaly  $R_c(t)$ is given by the radius where
advection of heat is equal to heat loss
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{d    t}\left(\theta(r=   R_c,t)\right)    \propto   Pe^{-1}
  \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2}\left(\theta(r=R_c,t)\right).

  h}{dt}&\propto& Pe^{-1} \frac{\Theta_b-\Theta_s}{h}\nonumber\\

\end{eqnarray}
where $\overline{\theta}$  is equal to $(\int_0^h  \theta dz)/h$ here.
Using     the     thickness     profile     (\ref{C3-IntrusionShape}),
(\ref{C4-Calcul2}) becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
  \alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2\left(\frac{2}{3}\left(\Theta_b-\Theta_s\right)\frac{d h_0}{d

                                                                \frac{Pe^{-1}\left(\Theta_b-\Theta_s\right)}{\alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2h_0}
                                                                \label{C4-bill}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha  (t)$ is the  normalized region beyond  $r=R_c(t)$, i.e.
$\alpha(t)= \left(R(t)-R_c(t)\right)/R(t)$. In  the limit $\alpha<<1$,
i.e.    $R_c/R\sim    1$,   neglecting   the   higher    order   terms
($\propto \alpha^2$),  i.e. the first  term on  the left hand  side of
(\ref{C4-bill}), leads  to the same  scaling law  for the size  of the
normalized cold  front region $\alpha$  than the one found  in section
(\ref{C3-sec:char-therm-anom-e}). However, it  clearly not matches the
prediction when $\Omega=1.0$ (Figure \ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0})
and the  new thermal anomaly evolution  must be linked to  a change in
the heat advection rate, i.e.  the  left hand side term in the balance
(\ref{C4-bill}).   Neglecting  the advection  term  to  keep only  the
inflation term in (\ref{C4-bill}) leads to
\begin{equation}
  \alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2\frac{d h_0}{d
    t}\propto \frac{Pe^{-1}}{\alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2h_0}
\end{equation}
which, in the limit $\alpha<<1$, becomes
\begin{equation}
  \alpha^4\frac{\partial h_0}{\partial
    t} \propto \frac{Pe^{-1}}{h_0\frac{\partial h_0}{\partial t}}.
\end{equation}
Substituting    $h_0(t)$    by     its    respective    scaling    law
(\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco}), the  relative size  of the  normalized cold
front region $\alpha$ reads
\begin{equation}
  \alpha(t) \propto h_f^{1/22}\nu^{1/11}Pe^{-1/4}t^{7/44}
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
  R(t)-R_c(t) = 0.8h_f^{1/11}\nu^{2/11}Pe^{-1/4}t^{17/44}
  \label{C4-ScalingRRc-Heating}
\end{equation}
where the numerical prefactor, which  depends on the definition of the
thermal anomaly, has been chosen to fit the simulations.

    \label{C4-ELAS_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The new predicted  scaling law for the evolution of  the extent of the
cold fluid  region (\ref{C4-ScalingRRc-Heating})  shows a  much better
match  with the  simulations (Figure  \ref{C4-ELAS_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0}
b). Therefore, the evolution of the thermal anomaly is governed by the
inflation rate at the intrusion tip when relaxing the thermal boundary
condition.  The  cold fluid region  grows slightly slower than  for an
isothermal   boundary  condition,   from  $t^{9/22}$   to  $t^{17/44}$
($9/22\sim 0.40$ , $17/44 \sim 0.38$) and the dependence in the Peclet
number $Pe$ is weaker, i.e. from  a power $1/3$ to $1/4$.  Indeed, for
small $Pe$,  the vertical  diffusion is  efficient on  the emplacement
time scale and rapidly heats up  the surrounding medium, the heat loss
in  the  interior  are  smaller  and the  thermal  anomaly  larger  in
comparison to the  case where $\Omega= 10^5$.  In  contrast, for large
values of $Pe$, the advection dominates  and the saving of heat due to
the heating  of the  medium is less  important decreasing  the overall
difference between small and large values of $Pe$.

      viscosity by $\nu$ and the time by $t_{b3}$.}
    \label{C4-Visco_ELAS_Heating}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As we show in section \ref{C4-sec:infl-therm-bound}, the time $t_{b2}$
for the current to enter the second bending phase does not change much
as  the delay  induced by  the heating  of the  surrounding medium  is
offset  by the  change  in  rheology.  Accordingly,  we  use the  time
(\ref{C3-tb2}) defined in  section \ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-e} to
characterize     the     first      bending     transition     (Figure
\ref{C4-Visco_ELAS_Heating} a). In contrast, the time $t_{b3}$ for the
current to enter the third phase of  the flow, which is defined as the
time for the effective viscosity to  reach $90\%$ of its maximum value
$\eta_c$  and  depends on  the  evolution  of  the cold  fluid  region
(Section \ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-e}), is now larger and equal to
\begin{equation}
  t_{b3}=0.4h_f^{-4/17}\nu^{-8/17}Pe^{11/17}St_m^{-11/17}
  \label{C4-tb3}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Size of the thermal aureole}
\label{C4-sec:char-therm-anom}

The size  of the  thermal aureole, the  heated region  surrounding the
current,  scales as  $(\kappa_r  \tau)^{1/2}$,  i.e.  $Pe^{-1/2}$  and
hence is  much larger  for small  values of  $Pe$.  Indeed,  for large
values of $Pe$, advection dominates  on the emplacement time scale and
the thermal aureole  is restricted to a small zone  around the current
(Figure \ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating}). For instance, the thickness of
the thermal aureole at the center  for $Pe=1.0$ is almost equal to the
current thickness $h_0$ whereas it is  only a few percent of $h_0$ for
$Pe=100.0$ (Figure \ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating}).

\section{Evolution in the gravity regime}
\label{C4-sec:evol-grav-regime}

As in chapter \ref{C3-JFM}, we now  consider the late time behavior in
which only the weight of the fluid contributes to the dynamic pressure
$P$. The governing equations are (\ref{C4-HF}) and (\ref{C4-TF}) where
$P=h$. We follow the same framework as in the previous section.

\subsection{Relaxing  the   thermal  boundary  condition,   effect  of
  $\Omega$}
\label{C4-sec:infl-therm-bound}

As in the  bending regime, for a small value  of $\Omega$, the heating
of the  surrounding medium limits heat  loss in the central  region of
the current and the thermal anomaly extends further into the flow. For
instance, for $Pe=1$ and $\nu=0.01$  at $t=200$, while $R_c\sim 1$ for
$\Omega=10^5$,  $R_c$ is  larger than  $5$  for $\Omega  =1 $  (Figure
\ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}).  In  addition, after  it detaches
from  the  current   tip,  the  thermal  anomaly  does   not  reach  a
steady-state  profile  but keeps  growing  with  time instead  (Figure
\ref{C4-Grid_TIME_GRAV}).   Indeed,  in  contrast  to  the  isothermal
boundary  case,  the  constant  increase of  the  surface  temperature
continuously  decreases the  heat loss  in the  central region  of the
current which allows  the propagation of the thermal  anomaly into the
flow.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{Snapshots of  the flow thermal  structure $\theta(r,z,t)$
      for  different  sets  ($Pe$,$\Omega$)  with  $Pe=  1.0$  ,$10.0$
      ,$100.0$   and   $\Omega=10^5$   and  $1.0$   at   $t=200$   for
      $\nu=0.01$. The  thermal structure in the  surrounding medium is
      given  by  (\ref{C4-eq11}) and  reads  in  a dimensionless  form
      $\Theta_r(r,z,t)=\Theta_s(r,t)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(Pe^{1/2}\frac{\kappa_m}{\kappa_r}\frac{(z-h)}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)}$
      where the ratio $\kappa_m/\kappa_r$ is set to $1$.}
    \label{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


For small values of $Pe$, the  efficient heat conduction results in an
almost    vertical    isothermal    current   at    $t=200$    (Figure
\ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}). In contrast,  for large values of
$Pe$, the  vertical diffusion of  heat is less efficient,  the thermal
aureole  is restricted  to a  small region  around the  intrusion, the
thermal anomaly is larger and the temperature gradient within the flow
are stronger (Figure \ref{C4-Grid_PeOmega_Heating_GRAV}).

\begin{figure}[h!]

      $\nu=0.01$. The  thermal structure in the  surrounding medium is
      given  by  (\ref{C4-eq11}) and  reads  in  a dimensionless  form
      $\Theta_r(r,z,t)=\Theta_s(r,t)\operatorname{erfc}{\left(Pe^{1/2}\frac{\kappa_m}{\kappa_r}\frac{(z-h)}{2\sqrt{t}}\right)}$
      where the ratio $\kappa_m/\kappa_r$ is set to $1$.}
    \label{C4-Grid_TIME_GRAV}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

While three phases also  characterized the dynamics when $\Omega=1.0$,
their extent  and duration  are modified by  the new  thermal boundary
condition (Figure \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega}).  In particular, the
current remains hot for a longueur period of time and the second phase
is  delayed in  comparison  to  the case  where  $\Omega =10^5$.   For
instance, for  $\nu=0.01$ and  $Pe=1.0$, while this  transition occurs
around  $t=0.1$ for  $\Omega=10^5$, it  happens only  after $t=1$  for
$\Omega=1$  (Figure \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega}).   As the  thermal
anomaly does not  reach a steady state for $\Omega=1$,  the cooling of
the current in the second phase  is also slower than for $\Omega=10^5$
and the current reaches the third phase also much later for $\Omega=1$
(Figure  \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega}).   In  the next  section,  we
consider  the  effect a  the  first  order  Arhenius rheology  on  the
dynamics for $\Omega=1.0$.

\subsection{Considering   a  more   realistic   rheology,  effect   of
  $\eta(\theta)$}
\label{C4-sec:cons-more-real-1}
 
As  in the  bending regime,  the chosen  rheology $\eta(\theta)$  also
affects the timing for the phase transition, and, in particular, these
transitions  occur  sooner  for  the first  order  Arrhenius  rheology
$\eta_2(\theta)$ than for $\eta=\eta_1(\theta)$.  In particular, as in
the  bending  regime,  the  delay   induced  by  the  heating  of  the
surrounding medium  is offset by  the first order  Arrhenius rheology,
i.e.     both    the    combination    ($\eta_1$,$\Omega=10^5$)    and
($\eta_2$,$\Omega=1$) transitions  to the second gravity  phase around
the    same     time    $t\sim     0.1$    for     $Pe=1.0$    (Figure
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Omega} and \ref{C4-HR_GRAV_Rheology}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Characterization of the thermal anomaly}
\label{C4-sec:char-therm-anom-2}

As in the bending regime, the thermal anomaly is first attached to the
tip of the current, i.e. $R_c(t)/R(t)=1$. After a time that depends on
$Pe$ as well  as $\nu$, the thermal anomaly detaches  from the tip and
follows  its own  evolution. However,  in contrast  to the  isoviscous
case, the  thermal anomaly does not  reach a steady state  and $R_c/R$
does not evolve as $t^{-1/2}$ (Figure \ref{C4-GRAV_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0}
a). As  in chapter  \ref{C3-JFM}, we develop  a simple  thermal budget
that accounts  for the heating  of the surrounding medium  to quantify
the evolution of the thermal anomaly.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}

      $Pe^{1/4}\nu^{-1/8}$.        Dotted-line:      scaling       law
      $(R_c(t)/R(t))Pe^{-1/4}\nu^{1/8}= 1.8t^{-1/4}$.}
    \label{C4-GRAV_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

When  the thermal  anomaly has  detached from  the intrusion  front, a
balance between heat advection and diffusion in the surrounding medium
in a dimensional form reads
\begin{equation}
  \rho C_p U_0 \frac{\Delta T}{R_c} \approx k_m \frac{\Delta T}{h_0^2}
  \label{C4-bilan}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta  T$ is the  mean temperature contrast between  the fluid
and the  surrounding and  $U_0$ is  taken as  a redistribution  of the
injection rate at $r=R_c$, i.e. $U_0=Q_0/(2\pi R_c h_0)$. In addition,
the continuity  of the  heat flux  at the  boundary (\ref{C4-2Flux_1})
imposes
\begin{equation}
  k_m\frac{\Delta   T}{h_0}\approx   k_s   \frac{\Delta   T}{\sqrt{\pi
      \kappa_r t}}.
  \label{C4-FluxEstimate}
\end{equation}
Injecting (\ref{C4-FluxEstimate}) and the  expression for the velocity
into (\ref{C4-bilan}) gives
\begin{equation}
  R_c \approx  \left(\frac{Q_0\kappa_r^{1/2}}{\kappa_m k_s}\right)^{1/2}
  t^{1/4}.
  \label{C4-Bilan2}
\end{equation}
By non-dimensionalizing (\ref{C4-Bilan2}), we  obtain the evolution of
the   thermal   anomaly   when   it  has   detached   from   the   tip
$R_c(t)\sim \Omega^{-2}Pe^{1/4}t^{1/4}$ and hence
\begin{equation}
  \frac{R_c(t)}{R(t)} = 1.8\Omega^{-2}Pe^{1/4}\nu^{-1/8}t^{-1/4}
  \label{C4-Rc}
\end{equation}
where   we  have   used  the   scaling   law  for   $R(t)$  given   by
(\ref{C3-scaling-R-gravi-2})  and   the  numerical   prefactor,  which
depends on the  definition of the thermal anomaly, has  been chosen to
fit the simulations. The scaling  law (\ref{C4-Rc}) indeed closely fit
the simulations  and both the  dependence with the Peclet  number $Pe$
and   the    viscosity   contrast    vanishes   when    rescaling   by
$Pe^{1/4}\nu^{-1/8}$ (Figure \ref{C4-GRAV_RRc_RArrhenius_1-0} b).

      viscosity by $\nu$ and the time by $t_{g3}$.}
    \label{C4-Visco_GRAV_Heating}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The time  $t_{g2}$ for the current  to enter the second  gravity phase
does  not change  much as  the  delay induced  by the  heating of  the
surrounding medium is offset by  the change in rheology.  Accordingly,
we  use the  time  (\ref{C3-tg2}) to  characterize  the first  gravity
transition  (Figure \ref{C4-Visco_GRAV_Heating}  a). In  contrast, the
time $t_{g3}$  for the current to  enter the third phase  of the flow,
which is  defined as  the time  for the  effective viscosity  to reach
$90\%$ of its  maximum value $\eta_c$ and depends on  the evolution of
the thermal anomaly (Section \ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-g}), is now
larger and equal to
\begin{equation}
  t_{g3}= 80 \Omega^{-8}\nu^{-1/2}Pe St_m^{-1}
  \label{C4-tg3}
\end{equation}

\section{Evolution  with bending  and  gravity in  the more  realistic
  model}
\label{C4-sec:evol-with-bend}

In the  previous chapter,  we showed  that the  final evolution  of an
elastic-plated gravity  current depends on the  relative phase changes
within  each regime  and the  transition between  the bending  and the
gravity regime  itself (Chapter  \ref{C3-JFM}). Because  the Arrhenius
rheology  compensates for  the delay  induced  by the  heating of  the
surrounding layer in both regimes,  the transition to the second phase
of the flow is not affected by the more realistic setting discussed in
this  chapter (Figure  \ref{C4-Phase_Diagram_Heating}). However,  when
the thermal anomaly has detached from the tip, it tends to grow slower
in this setting and therefore, the  third phase of the flow is reached
later in both regimes.

The phase diagram presented in section (\ref{C3-sec:diff-evol-with-1})
show only minor modifications (Figure \ref{C4-Phase_Diagram_Heating}).
In particular, the  currents that transition into  the gravity current
from  the  third thermal  bending  phase  occurs when  $t_t^c>t_{b3}$;
comparing       $t_t^c$       and       $t_{b3}$       now       gives
$\nu>2.8~10^{-7}Pe_m^{7/2}h_f^{-1/2}$.   In  that  configuration,  the
current  transitions to  the second  gravity phase  for $t_t^c<t_g^3$,
i.e.  for $\nu<10^5~Pe^{14/3}h_f^{2/3}$ and to the third gravity phase
otherwise.    The   other   transitions    do   not   change   (Figure
\ref{C4-Phase_Diagram_Heating}).   Overall,  the scenarios  where  the
current transitions  to the gravity  regime before reaching  the third
bending  phase is  thus more  likely  for the  range of  dimensionless
number considered in this study.

\section{Application to the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusion}
\label{C4-sec:appl-spre-shall}

\subsection{Elba Island christmas tree laccolith complex}
\label{C4-sec:appl-arrest-terr}

The isoviscous elastic-plated  gravity current model has  been used in
Chapter   \ref{chap2}  to   study  the   laccoliths  of   Elba  Island
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}. It shows that, while their final morphology is
consistent with  their arrest in  the bending regime,  their dimension
requires unreasonable magma viscosity to agree with the model (Chapter
\ref{chap2}).   In addition,  given the  fracture toughness  of rocks,
their  radius seems  too small  to be  fractured controlled  and their
arrest    might    be    better    explained    by    their    cooling
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}.  In  the following,  we compare the  new model
predictions   to   the   size    of   the   laccoliths   provided   by
\citet{Rocchi:2002jy}.  In order to account for the intrinsic scale of
different settings for  each intrusion and compare them  to the model,
the  data have  first  to be  nondimensionalized using  characteristic
values  for   each  intrusion  parameters  as   discussed  in  chapter
\ref{chap2}.

\subsubsection*{Range of values for the dimensionless numbers}
\label{C4-sec:range-valu-dimens}
 
The different parameters along with a discussion on the possible value
for $h_f$ have been provided in chapter \ref{chap2} and are summarized
in   table   \ref{C4-tab}.    we   refer   the   reader   to   Section
\ref{C2-sec:observ-vs-pred} for  more details about  their derivation.
In  the following,  we quantify  the value  for the  new dimensionless
number introduced by the cooling of the current in the setting of Elba
Island laccoliths.

For a latent heat of crystallization $L = 4.18\times10^5$ J kg$^{-1}$,
a   difference  between   solidus  temperature   $T_S$  and   liquidus
temperature  $T_L$ between  $100$ K  and  $300$ K,  the number  $St_m$
varies from $0.1$  to $0.5$.  For a thermal diffusivity  for the magma
equal  to $\kappa_m=  10^{-6}$  m s$^{-2}$,  an  injection rate  $Q_0$
between $0.1$ and $100$ m$^3$  s$^{-1}$ and an intrusion depth between
$0.2$ and $2.7$  km, the Peclet number varies from  $10^{-3}$ to $100$
and  therefore, $Pe_m$  varies from  $0.01$ to  $1000$.  Finally,  the
increase in viscosity  upon cooling varies from $4$ to  $10$ orders of
magnitude               for                felsic               magmas
\citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Lejeune:1995fc,Giordano:2008em,Diniega:2013eh}.
We  thus consider  values of  $\nu$  that vary  between $10^{-4}$  and
$10^{-10}$.

It is  generally assume  that magma stops  spreading when  its crystal
content becomes close  to its maximum packing, i.e.   $\phi \sim 60\%$
\citep{Pinkerton:1992fw}.   Beyond  this   point,  crystal  collisions
dominate   and   the   viscosity   jumps   to   much   higher   values
\citep{Lejeune:1995fc,Giordano:2008em}.   We   assume  that   this  is
equivalent to  $\eta_e$ tending to  $\eta_c$ in our model.   With this
assumption, the  model thus predicts  that a magmatic  intrusion would
solidify as a  laccolith upon reaching the third thermal  phase of the
bending regime.

\subsubsection*{Do laccoliths stop in the bending regime?}
\label{C4-sec:range-valu-dimens}

The thickness $h_0$ as a function of its radius $R$ for a current that
solidifies in  the third phase  of the  bending regime can  be derived
from     the     scaling    laws     (\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco})     and
(\ref{C3-ScalingR-Visco}) and should follow
\begin{equation}
  h_0 = 0.3 h_f^{-1/7}\nu^{-2/7}R^{8/7}\label{C4-Hr}
\end{equation}

      $H$    (\ref{C3-H1})    are    $E=10^9$    GPa,    $\nu^*=0.25$,

      Island.   Substituting  (\ref{C3-T1})   into  (\ref{C3-Pe}),  we
      obtain $Pe = Q_0 H  /(\pi \kappa \Lambda^2)$; the parameters for
      calculating $Pe$ for each laccolith are the same than those used
      for the  nondimensionalization, $\kappa=10^{-6}$ m  s$^{-2}$ and
      $St_m$ is considered  constant and set to  $0.1$.  The viscosity
      contrast is set  to $\nu =6.9\cdot 10^{-8}$  for all laccoliths.
      Dotted line: scaling law $ \hat{h_0} \sim 0.3\hat{R}^{8/7}$.}
    \label{C4-Data}

The  observations show  a very  good agreement  with the  model for  a
viscosity    contrast   close    to    $8$    orders   of    magnitude
($\nu =  6.9\pm 2.3 \times  10^{-8}$, $r^2=0.9$), which  is consistent
with  the  felsic composition  of  these  laccoliths, and  $h_f=0.001$
(Figure \ref{C4-Data} a) \citep{Marsh:1981dc,Diniega:2013eh}.  Varying
$h_f$ has only minor effect on  the best fit viscosity contrast and is
discussed in Appendix \ref{C4-Heat:AppendixC}.  Therefore, introducing
the  cooling in  the elastic-plated  gravity current  model allows  to
reconciliate the model predictions and the observations in the case of
laccoliths  (Chapter \ref{chap2}).   In particular,  the shape  of the
laccolith at Elba Island is  now consistent with the model predictions
and therefore with their arrest in the bending regime.

\subsubsection*{What can we learn from the phase diagram ?}

Assuming that  the intrusion stops  when it reaches the  third bending
phase,     the      phase     diagram     proposed      in     section
\ref{C4-sec:evol-with-bend}  simplifies  (Figure  \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).
It shows that sills and laccoliths are two specific end member regions
as a function of $Pe$ and  $\nu$. In particular, while the top portion
of the phase diagram corresponds  to magmatic intrusions more mafic in
composition,  the  bottom  should  be more  representative  of  felsic
magmatic intrusions.  The  boundary between the two  regions show that
felsic magmatic intrusions  should solidify as sill on  a larger range
of number $Pe$. Indeed, felsic  magmatic intrusions tend to be thicker
than their mafic counterpart. In the framework of our model, they then
stay hot  for a longueur period  of time and therefore,  can reach the
gravity  regime  more  easily.   Given the  observations,  the  felsic
composition  of laccolith  at  Elba island  for  instance, this  phase
diagram can then  be used to constrain the physical  parameters of the
magma. In the following, we use  this approach to better constrain the
injection rate feeding these laccoliths at the time of emplacement.

We first compute  a value for the Peclet number  for each laccolith at
Elba  Island  using  its  corresponding depth  of  intrusion  and  the
parameter  listed  in  Figure   \ref{C4-Data}.   Injecting  the  scale
(\ref{C3-H1}), (\ref{C3-L1}), (\ref{C3-T1}) in  the expression of $Pe$
(\ref{C3-Pe}), we  find that  in term  of the  injection rate  and the
depth of intrusion $d_c$, $Pe$ reads
\begin{equation}
  Pe \sim 10^3 d_c^{-3/2} Q^{5/4}.
\end{equation}
For $St_m  =0.5$, the intrusion depths  given by \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}
and  $Q_0 =10$  m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$,  the modified  Peclet number  $Pe_m$
ranges from  $1$ to  $6$.  As  the best  fit range  of values  for the
viscosity   contrast,   discussed   in  the   previous   section,   is
$\nu = 6.9\pm 2.3 \times 10^{-8}$, the phase diagram thus predict that
these laccoliths  should have  stop in  the gravity  regime indicating
that we might have overestimated the injection rate.  Indeed, taking a
smaller value  for the injection  rate of $Q_0=0.1$  m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$,
reasonable for viscous felsic  magmas \citep{Harris:2000jd}, the model
predicts  a larger  viscosity contrast  $\nu=1.2\pm0.4\times 10^{-9}$,
still consistent with  the range of expected value  for felsic magmas,
and  weaker Peclet  numbers. Therefore,  the range  of values  for the
dimensionless numbers  now fall  within the  laccolith regions  and is
consistent with the observations (Figure \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).

\subsubsection*{Is   conduction   cooling   enough   to   solifidy   a
  laccolith ?}

If the laccoliths stopped spreading as  soon as they reached the third
phase of the  bending regime, the variance in thickness  and radius in
between  the   different  intrusions  should  also   be  explained  by
variations  in the  Peclet number,  most likely  due to  variations in
intrusion  depths  in  this   example.   Indeed,  the  time  $t_{b3}$,
necessary  to  reach  the  third  phase of  the  bending  regime,  the
thickness and the radius of the current at this time all depend on the
combination      ($\nu$,$Pe_m$)      considered      (see      Section
\ref{C4-sec:evol-with-bend}).

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Visco_PE_Heating.eps}
    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless radius $R$ for different sets $(\nu,Pe)$ indicated

      size where the  effective viscosity of the  current equal $70\%$
      of  the maximum  viscosity  $\eta_c$, i.e.   $\eta_e=0.7\eta_c$.

      $h_f=0.001$.  As  expected, after  rescaling $h_0$ and  $R$, the
      sizes of the laccolith when it solidifies collapse almost on the
      same point. }
    \label{C4-Visco_PE_Heating}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}


To  test this  hypothesis, we  rescale  the variables  using the  time
$t_{b3}$ (\ref{C4-tb3}) as follow
\begin{equation}
  \hat{t}=   h_f^{4/17}  Pe_m^{-11/17}\nu^{8/17}t      \hspace{.5cm}     \hat{R}=
  h_f^{1/34}Pe_m^{-7/34}\nu^{1/17}R\hspace{.5cm}                        \hat{h_0}=
  h_f^{3/17}Pe_m^{-4/17}\nu^{6/17}h_0
  \label{C4-Scaling2}
\end{equation}
where  the viscosity  contrast and  the prewetting  film thickess  are
constant,  i.e. $\nu  =  8.2\cdot 10^{-9}$  and  $h_f=0.001$, and  the
Peclet number  varied between  each laccolith  (Figure \ref{C4-Data}).
In term  of $\hat{h_0}$ and  $\hat{R}$, the scaling  law (\ref{C4-Hr})
rewrites $ \hat{h_0} \sim 0.3\hat{R}^{8/7}$ and does not depend on the
dimensionless            numbers            anymore            (Figure
\ref{C4-Visco_PE_Heating}). However,  the different laccoliths  do not
collapse on the same dot after rescaling (Figure \ref{C4-Data} b).  In
particular,  the dependence  of $Pe$  of our  scaling, resulting  from
different intrusion depths,  is not enough to  explain the variability
in  the  size  of   terrestrial  laccoliths.   An  additional  cooling
mechanism, amplifying the effect of  $Pe$, is thus required to explain
the exact extent  of laccoliths, which could be extraction  of heat by
circulation of fluid on Earth. To test this hypothesis, we look at the
low-slope domes on  the Moon where conduction is more  likely the only
source of cooling.

\subsection{Low-slope lunar domes}
\label{sec:appl-arrest-terr-1}

Circulation of  fluid in the lunar  crust is more likely  to be absent
and the model  develop in this chapter seems  appropriate for studying
the cooling of low-slope lunar domes. In this section, we restrict our
analysis  to  some  specific  domes whose  characteristics  have  been
precisely   revisited  by   Mélanie   Thiriet   (Purple  dots   Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}}).   Their  shapes   and  characteristics  have
already been discussed  in chapter \ref{chap2} and  hereafter, we look
at their dimension in the  light of the cooling elastic-plated gravity
current model developed in this chapter.

\subsubsection*{Range of values for the dimensionless numbers}
\label{C4-sec:range-valu-dimens}

Parameters  for the  magma in  lunar  setting have  been discussed  in
chapter  \ref{chap2} and  are  summarized in  table \ref{C4-tab}.   In
particular, the smaller gravity, together  with the higher density and
smaller viscosity of lunar magmas  leads to smaller Peclet number. For
instance, for an  intrusion $1.5$ km deep, using  $g=1.62$ m s$^{-2}$,
$\eta_h=1$ Pa  s and $\rho_m=2900$  kg m$^{-3}$ instead of  $g=9.81$ m
s$^{-2}$, $\eta_h=10^6$  Pa s and  $\rho_m=2500$ kg m$^{-3}$  leads to
Peclet number  two orders  of magnitude  smaller on  the Moon  than on
Earth, i.e.  $Pe=0.04$ and  $Pe=1.8$ respectively.  However, injection
rates on the Moon are also more likely to be larger than on Earth and,
overall,  for $Q_0$  between $1$  and  $10^4$ m$^3$  s$^{-1}$ and  $d$
between $0.5$ and $1.5$ km, the Peclet number varies from $10^{-3}$ to
$10^4$.  Therefore, taking the same value than on Earth for $St_m$, we
have  $Pe_m$ that  varies  between $0.01$  and  $10^5$. The  viscosity
contrast for lunar basalt is more likely to be smaller than for felsic
magmas,   i.e.   $\nu$   varies   between   $10^{-3}$  and   $10^{-5}$
\citep{Diniega:2013eh}

\subsubsection*{Constraining the magma physical properties}
\label{sec:visc-contr-lunar}

For an injection rate of  $Q_0=10$ m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$ and the parameters
listed in Table \ref{C4-tab}, the  low-slope lunar dome dimensions are
also consistent with  a viscosity contrast of $8$  order of magnitudes
(best    fit:   $\nu=1.8    \pm   0.4    \times   10^{-8}$)    (Figure
\ref{C4-Data}). Assuming that the intrusion  depth ranges from $500$ m
to $5$ km, the Peclet number ranges from $0.1$ to $1$ and the range of
values for the dimensionless number  falls at the boundary between the
two domains in  the phase diagram (Figure  \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).  It is
consistent with the radius of these  lunar domes being close to $R=4$,
i.e.   close  to  the  transition  radius  with  the  gravity  regime.
However, the estimate  for the viscosity contrast is  much larger than
the value expected for mafic magmas. For the same injection rate and a
viscosity for the magma at  liquidus temperature of $\eta_h=10^3$ Pa s
instead  of $\eta_h=1$  Pa s$^{-1}$,  the model  predicts a  viscosity
contrast      close     to      $5$      orders     of      magnitudes
($\nu = 6.9 \pm 1.8 \times10^{-6}$), much closer to the expected value
(Figure  \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).   A  similar  value  for  the  viscosity
contrast  can be  obtained for  $\eta_h=1$ Pa  s and  $Q_0=1500$ m$^3$
s$^{-1}$. However,  in that case,  the Peclet numbers are  much larger
and the range of values for  the dimensionless numbers fall within the
sill  region  (Figure  \ref{C4-PhaseDiag}).    It  suggests  that  the
injection  rates for  these  lunar  domes were  most  likely close  to
$Q_0\sim 10$ m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$, hence a few orders of magnitude smaller
than the  effusion rates estimated  for some  lava flows in  the lunar
maria i.e.  $Q_0\ge 10^6$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ \citep{TracyKPGregg:1996wp}.

\subsubsection*{Is conductive  cooling enough to solidify  a laccolith
  on the Moon ?}
\label{sec:visc-contr-lunar}

On the  moon, the dimensionless sizes  of the domes vary  by less than
one order  of magnitude and  might be  explain only by  the conductive
cooling of the magmatic intrusion (Figure \ref{C4-Data}). However, the
depth   of  these   intrusions   have  not   yet   been  reported   by
\citet{Wohler:2009jj}  and  we can  not  proceed  as for  Elba  Island
laccoliths. Instead, we estimate a range of intrusion depth that would
produce a collapse of the rescaled size of the domes, i.e. $\hat{h_0}$
as a function of $\hat{R}$.  Indeed, assuming that the different lunar
domes  differ  only  by  their  intrusion  depth,  $\hat{R}=\hat{R}_r$
implies that
\begin{equation}
  d_c = \left(R/R^r\right)^{34/15}d_c^r
  \label{C4-dd}
\end{equation}
where the  radii are with  dimension and  the topscript $r$  denotes a
reference dome. We take the largest dome as a reference and we set its
depth to  the largest  reasonable value, i.e.   $d_c=5$ km,  mainly to
ensure that the  dimensionless radius of the other  domes stay smaller
than  $4$.   Injecting  the  dome radii  in  (\ref{C4-dd})  then  give
intrusion  depths between  $0.5$  km  and $5$  km  and Peclet  numbers
between   $10^{-2}$  and   $0.5$  in   agreement  with   the  expected
values. However, while  this new parameters result in  the collapse of
$\hat{R}$ for the different domes,  the variation in Peclet number can
not account for the dispersion  in the dome thicknesses.  In addition,
the dimensionless thickness as a  function of the dimensionless radius
does  not follow  the  scaling law  (\ref{C4-Hr})  anymore.  The  same
observations are obtained  using different domes as a  reference or by
setting the constrain on the rescaled thickness instead of the radius,
i.e. $\hat{h}=\hat{h}_r$.

\subsection{Large mafic sill}
\label{sec:large-mafic-sill}


As we discussed in chapter \ref{chap2},  the size of large mafic sills
reported by \citet{Cruden:tg}  show an increase in  the thickness with
diameter  apparently  in  contradiction with  the  constant  thickness
predicted by the model  (Figure \ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}).  One possible
explanation  is that  the different  sill have  been fed  at different
injection  rates  and  are  then  characterized  by  different  height
scales. Forcing the dimensionless thicknesses of different sills to be
constant imposes that
\begin{equation}
  Q_0 = (h_0/h_0^r)Q_r.
\end{equation}
where  $h_0$   thickness  of   a  sill   with  dimension,   $Q_0$  the
corresponding injection rate and  $h_0^r$ and $Q_0^r$ reference values
for  this parameters.   Taking the  thickest sill  as a  reference and
$Q_0^r = 10^4$  m$^3$ s$^{-1}$, we find that in  order to collapse all
the data over a constant thickness, the injection rate have to vary by
at  least  $7$  orders  of magnitudes,  i.e.   from  $Q_0=10^{-3}$  to
$Q_0= 10^{4}$  m$^3$ s$^{-1}$  which is far  larger than  the expected
range of  variations for this  parameter.  In addition,  assuming that
they  stop as  soon  as they  reached the  third  gravity regime,  the
scaling  law (\ref{C3-scaling-H-gravi-2})  gives  an  estimate of  the
viscosity  contrast which  for the  largest injection  rate considered
$Q_0^r=10^4$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ is equal to $8$ orders of magnitudes, also
larger than the expected value for mafic intrusions.  Another possible
explanation  is that  large  mafic sill  have  stop their  propagation
during the  second gravity phase  when their driving pressure  is weak
enough  so that  it can  not fracture  the rocks  at the  tip anymore.
Indeed,  while  fracturation  is   not  sufficient  to  stop  magmatic
intrusion  in the  bending regime,  it  might be  responsible for  the
arrest  of large  mafic sills  \citep{Michaut:2011kg}.  In  that case,
sills would stop at different time  in the second gravity regime which
could thus  explain the  increase in  thickness with  diameter without
requiring such larger range  of injection rates.  However, information
about  the intrusion  depth, surrounding  geology  as well  as on  the
relationship between the different sill  units, which are not given by
\citet{Cruden:tg},  would be  require to  precisely study  these large
mafic intrusions.


\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}


\newpage
\section*{Appendix A: Main variables}
\label{C4-Heat:AppendixA}

The variable $\xi$ is the sufficient variable to solve for in the heat
transport equation (\ref{C4-TF}). Indeed,
\begin{equation}
  \xi&=&\frac{\delta}{3} \left(- 2 \Theta_{b} - \Theta_{s} + 3\right)\label{C4-xi}
\end{equation}
where   we    have   used   (\ref{C4-tbar}).    In    addition,   from
(\ref{C4-Boundary-Condi}), we can rewrite
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Theta_s &=& \frac{2 \Theta_{b}}{\beta \delta + 2}\label{C4-Ts},\\
  \delta  &=&   \frac{1}{\Theta_{s}  \beta}   \left(2  \Theta_{b}   -  2
              \Theta_{s}\right)\label{C4-D},\\
  \Theta_b &=& \frac{\Theta_{s}}{2} \left(\beta \delta + 2\right)\label{C4-Tb}
\end{eqnarray}
When  the  thermal  boundary  layer just  merged,  then  $\Theta_b=1$,
$\delta = h/2$ and injecting (\ref{C4-Ts}) into (\ref{C4-xi}) gives
\begin{equation}
  \xi_t(t)=\frac{\beta(t) h^{2}{\left (r,t \right )}}{6 \beta(t) h{\left (r,t \right )}
    + 24}\label{C4-xit}
\end{equation}
Therefore,  when  $\xi<\xi_t$,  the  thermal boundary  layer  are  not
merged, $\Theta_b=1$ and injecting (\ref{C4-D}) into (\ref{C4-xi}) and
solving for $\Theta_s$ gives
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_s = \frac{3 \beta}{4} \xi - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \sqrt{\beta \xi \left(3 \beta \xi + 8\right)} + 1.
\end{equation}
In contrast, when $\xi>\xi_t$, the  thermal boundary layer are merged,
$\delta=h/2$  and  injecting   (\ref{C4-Tb})  into  (\ref{C4-xi})  and
solving for $\Theta_s$ gives
\begin{equation}
  \Theta_s = \frac{- 12 \xi + 6 h}{\left(\beta h + 6\right) h}.
\end{equation}

\section*{Appendix B: Integral expressions}
\label{C4-Heat:AppendixB}

The model  developed in  Section \ref{C4-sec:theory-1} depends  on the
integrals
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_0(z)&=&\int_0^z\frac{1}{\eta(y)}\left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)
            dy \\
  I_1(z) &=& \int_0^z\frac{1}{\eta(y)}\left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)y dy\\
  I_2(z)&=&\int_0^y                         \frac{1}{\eta(y)}
            \left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)G(y)dy
\end{eqnarray}
where $G(z)$  is a  primitive of $\theta(z)$  where $z<\delta$  and is
given by
\begin{equation}
  G(z) = \frac{z \left(3 \delta ^2 \Theta_s+3 \delta z (\Theta_b-\Theta_s)+z^2 (\Theta_s-\Theta_b)\right)}{3 \delta ^2}.
\end{equation}
In  particular, the  model requires  the expression  of $I_0(\delta)$,
$I_1(\delta)$, $I_1(h)$ and $I_2(\delta)$.

\vspace{.5cm}   \textbf{Rheology   1:   $\eta(\theta)=\eta_1(\theta)$}
\vspace{.5cm}

In that case, the four integrals can be easily derived and read
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_0(\delta)&=&\frac{\delta}{12} \left(6 \delta \nu + (1-\nu) \left(- \alpha_1 \delta + 2 \alpha_1 h + 6 \Theta_{b} \delta - 6 \Theta_{b} h\right) - 6 h \nu\right)\nonumber\\
  I_1(\delta)&=&\frac{\delta^{2}}{120} \left(40 \delta \nu + (1-\nu) \left(- 4 \alpha_1 \delta + 5 \alpha_1 h + 40 \Theta_{b} \delta - 30 \Theta_{b} h\right) - 30 h \nu\right)\nonumber\\
  I_1(h)&=&\frac{1}{60} \left((1-\nu) \left(- 4 \alpha_1 \delta^{3} + 10 \alpha_1 \delta^{2} h - 10 \alpha_1 \delta h^{2} + 5 \Theta_{b} h^{3}\right) + 5 h^{3} \nu\right)\nonumber\\
  I_2(\delta)&=&- \frac{\delta^{2}}{2520} \left(378  \alpha_1 \delta \nu -
                 315  \alpha_1 h  \nu -  840 \Theta_{b}  \delta \nu  + 630
                 \Theta_{b} h \nu \right)\nonumber\\
             &&-\frac{\delta^{2}}{2520}(1-\nu)  \left(- 50  \alpha_1^{2} \delta  + 70
                \alpha_1^{2}  h  +  462  \alpha_1   \Theta_{b}  \delta  -  420  \alpha_1
                \Theta_{b}  h -  840  \Theta_{b}^{2} \delta  + 630  \Theta_{b}^{2}
                h\right)\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha=\Theta_b-\Theta_s$ has been introduced for clarity.

\vspace{.5cm}   \textbf{Rheology   2:   $\eta(\theta)=\eta_2(\theta)$}
\vspace{.5cm}

For cases where $\nu<1$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_0(\delta)&=&-\frac{\delta  \nu ^{1-\Theta_b} \left(\sqrt{\pi } \sqrt{\alpha_1} (2 \delta -h) \sqrt{-\alpha_2}
                 \text{erf}\left(\sqrt{\alpha_1} \sqrt{-\alpha_2}\right)+2 \delta  \left(\nu ^{\alpha_1}-1\right)\right)}{4 \alpha_1 \alpha_2}\nonumber\\
  I_1(\delta)&=&\frac{\delta ^2 \nu ^{1-\Theta_b} \left(\sqrt{\pi } \erf\left(\sqrt{\alpha_1} \sqrt{-\alpha_2}\right) (\alpha_1 (h-2
                 \delta ) \alpha_2+\delta )\right)}{4           \alpha_1^{3/2}          (-\alpha_2)^{3/2}}\nonumber\\
             &&+\frac{\delta ^2 \nu ^{1-\Theta_b} \left(\sqrt{\alpha_1} \sqrt{-\alpha_2} \left(2 \delta  \left(\nu ^{\alpha_1}-2\right)-h \nu

            \log    (\nu    )\right)\rihgt)}{12   \alpha_1^{3/2}    (-\alpha_2)^{3/2}}\nonumber\\
             &&-\frac{\nu ^{1-\Theta_b} \left(3 \sqrt{\pi } \delta

\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}

\end{eqnarray}
where    in   addition    to    $\alpha_1$,    we   also    introduced
$\alpha_2=log(\nu)$  for  clarity.  In  the  case  where $\nu=1$,  the
expression above simplify and read
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_0(\delta)&=&\frac{1}{2} \delta  (\delta -h)\nonumber\\

\end{eqnarray}

\section*{Appendix C: Second phase of the bending regime}
\label{C4-Heat:AppendixC}

For some simulations, the second  phase of important thickening in the
bending regime occurs in two stages: a first stage where the thickness
drastically increases and a second stage where it continues increasing
but   much    slower   (Figure    \ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Omega}   and
\ref{C4-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Rheology}).   To get  some insights  into this
transition, we  run some  simulations for  $\Omega=1.0$ with  a higher
spatial  resolution, i.e.   $Dr=0.005$  instead  of $Dr=0.01$  (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).

The  simulations   show  that  this  transition   corresponds  to  the
detachment       of       the      thermal       anomaly       (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).     In    particular,
during the first  stage, the thermal anomaly is still  attached to the
tip  and  the  prewetting  film, located  beyond  $r=R(t)$,  is  still
cooling.  In contrast, during the second stage, which is characterized
by  a decrease  in the  thickening rate,  the prewetting  film located
beyond $r=R(t)$  is entirely cold  , i.e.  $\overline{\theta}  =0$ for
$r>R(t)$ and the thermal anomaly slowly gets away from the tip (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}).   For  instance,  for
$\eta_1(\theta)$, $\nu=0.001$ and  $Pe=100.0$, the transitions between
the two  stages occurs at  $t=1.8~10^{-2}$ and indeed coincide  to the
film          becoming          entirely         cold          (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001}  a,  b,  c).   For  the
rheology  $\eta_2(\theta)$, the  transition  is  smoother because  the
viscosity   increases  on   a  wide   range  of   temperature  (Figure
\ref{C4-Appendix_Phase2_N11_0_Pe100_0_nu0_001} d, e,  f). Even if this
transition  should be  present for  all the  simulations, the  smaller
spatial resolution  used in this  chapter and chapter  \ref{C4-JFM} do
not allow to  resolve this transition for all the  combinations of the
dimensionless numbers.

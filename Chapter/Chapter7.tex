\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary-2}

\citet{Michaut:2011kg}  originally  provided  a model  describing  the
dynamics of shallow isoviscous  magmatic intrusions.  Depending mainly
on the injection rate and the  intrusion depth, the model predicts two
propagation regimes characterized by specific morphologies and scaling
laws  for  intrusion thickness  versus  length  and time.   The  model
predicts the appropriate geometry  for both terrestrial laccoliths and
large mafic  sills. However,  we show in  Chapter \ref{chap2}  that it
underestimates   the    absolute   dimensions   of    these   magmatic
intrusions. In  particular, it  requires abnormally high  viscosity to
reconcile both observations and predictions.

To investigate  the effective  flow viscosity,  we develop  in chapter
\ref{C3-JFM}  and   \ref{Heating}  an   extension  of  the   model  of
\citet{Michaut:2011kg} accounting  for the cooling.  We  show that the
resulting coupling between  the temperature field and  the flow itself
leads to  the formation of  a highly viscous  region at the  tip which
slows  down  the  spreading  in  both  regimes.   The  intrusions  are
predicted  to  be thicker  and  their  dimensions, especially  in  the
bending regime, are now consistent with observations.

In Chapter  \ref{C5-chap6}, we  neglect the  cooling to  relax another
assumption of  the original model of  \citet{Michaut:2011kg}, i.e. the
constant thickness  of the  upper layer. In  particular, we  study the
effect of a crater depression located on top of the intrusion. We show
that  the  lithostatic barrier  imposed  by  the  crater wall  at  the
depression periphery prevents lateral  spreading and enhances vertical
thickening. This second model also shows predictions consistent with
the deformations observed at floor-fractured craters.

Promising  comparison between  predictions  and  observations such  as
these  should  drive a  methodical  and  rigorous improvement  of  the
mathematical model for the emplacement of shallow magmatic intrusions.
Nevertheless,  we also  show the  limit of  using field  observations,
whose  parameters  are  poorly  constrained,  to  validate  the  model
predictions.   An  alternative  approach  could  be  to  use  analogue
experiments designed to produce some  feature of the natural system at
a  laboratory scale.   Indeed, such  experiments could  provide useful
benchmarks   constraining  the   theoretical   model.   In   addition,
phenomenological observations not predicted  by the theory could guide
further investigations  towards our understanding of  shallow magmatic
intrusions.

\section{What limits the extent of magmatic intrusions?}
\label{sec:summary-2}

While  the crater  depression clearly  limits the  flow expansion  for
crater-centered intrusions,  one can  wonder about why  laccoliths and
sills stop  their propagation  in the third  bending phase  and second
gravity phase respectively. Available  data on terrestrial laccoliths,
used in combination  with the model, show  that terrestrial laccoliths
probably do  not stop  following the formation  of the  highly viscous
region at the intrusion front (Section \ref{Heating}).

Instead, an alternative hypothesis is that the limited volume of magma
initially   available    simply   limits    the   extent    of   these
intrusions. Indeed, one  may expect that the injection  rate, which is
considered constant in this model, wanes as the deep magma source gets
exhausted.   Depending on  the  local emplacement  conditions, if  the
injection rate lasts sufficiently long for the intrusion to transition
to the gravity regime, the intrusion solidifies as a sill.  Otherwise,
the intrusion  solidifies as a  laccolith.  The current  thickness and
time  at  the   transition  depend  on  the   magma  composition.   In
particular, the  more evolved  the magma  composition, the  larger the
transition time and the larger  the volume required for the transition
to  occur.   Together,  it  corroborates the  predominance  of  felsic
laccoliths and mafic sills in field observations.

In  addition, in  chapter \ref{Heating},  we show  that a  significant
thermal aureole  should develop  in the wall  rocks above  the central
flow region. Apart from plastic rock deformation that might develop in
the overburden, the  thermal erosion above the feeder  dyke, where the
temperature are  expected to be  maximum, might also  favor subsequent
dyke  propagation  and  limit  the intrusion  size.  This  could  also
potentially  explain   the  nested  structure  of   several  laccolith
complexes reported in the literature \citep{E:2015tl,Rocchi:2010dn}.

Alternatively, fracturation  at the  front could  limit the  extent of
some magmatic intrusions and trigger  their arrest. Indeed, for a sake
of simplicity, we used a thin prewetting  film at the tip to avoid the
requirement of any boundary condition at a genuine front in the models
developed in this thesis.  Nevertheless, a necessary extension of this
work  is the  description of  a  realistic boundary  condition at  the
intrusion front which includes a realistic fracturation criterion.

\section{Rigorous treatment of the front}
\label{sec:rigor-treatm-front}

\subsubsection*{Fracturation}
\label{sec:fracturation}

A first step  would be to describe  the tip in term of  a fluid driven
fracture  instead of  the thin  prewetting  film. As  seen in  Section
\ref{C2-Toughness},  linear elastic  fracture mechanics  requires that
the  mode $I$  intensity factor  $K_I$  equals a  critical value,  the
fracture toughness  of the wall  rock $K_{c}$, for the  propagation to
occur. This  condition is usually  expressed in term of  an asymptotic
condition    on    the    crack     opening    $h(r,t)$    at    $r=R$
\citep{Savitski:2002gy,Bunger:2005em,Bunger:2007vs,Detournay:2014fk}.

In  such  problem,  the  thickness  equation  is  thus  coupled  to  a
description  of  the fracture  opening  based  on the  linear  elastic
fracture mechanics. \citet{Bunger:2011cb} used  this approach to solve
the  problem  of  isoviscous  shallow magmatic  intrusions  and  found
similar  results  than  \citet{Michaut:2011kg}.   Interestingly,  they
needed values for the fracture toughness  $K_c$ two or three orders of
magnitudes  larger  than  laboratory  measurements  to  reproduce  the
observations.   In addition,  they  found that  the apparent  fracture
toughness of  laccoliths is  much larger than  for large  mafic sills,
which they  attribute to potentially  crack blunting mechanism  at the
tip  of laccoliths.   This observation  is consistent  with the  rapid
formation  of  a highly  viscous  plug  at  the  tip of  the  magmatic
intrusion      described     in      Chapter     \ref{C3-JFM}      and
\ref{Heating}. Nevertheless, this model  also falls short to reproduce
the behavior of large mafic sills.  In addition, more realistic models
should also consider the process zone, i.e. the region of plastic rock
deformation    near    the    leading    edge    of    the    fracture
\citep{Bunger:2008cl}.

Finally, the large negative pressure that developed at the front might
cause    dissolved    gasses    to     exsolve    from    the    magma
\citep{Lister:2013ia}. With the  formation and the evolution  of a gap
filled with gas  at the current tip, the fluid  and the fracture front
do not coincide  with one another, thus requiring the  tracking of two
moving boundaries.

\subsubsection*{Fluid gap}
\label{sec:fracturation}

Along      with      the     prewetting      film      regularization,
\citet{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV} propose  a second  regularization condition
where the tip of the elastic-plated  gravity current consists of a lag
region  filled  with  gas  at a  constant  negative  pressure  (Figure
\ref{C7-Sketch}).   They show  that the  solution depends  on the  gas
pressure in  the tip  region in  a similar  fashion that  the solution
depends  on  the prewetting  film  thickness  in Chapter  \ref{chap2},
\ref{C3-JFM} and \ref{Heating}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
 \begin{center}
 \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Manuscript/Figure/Chapter7/} }
 \includegraphics[scale=1.3]{Sketch.eps}
 \caption{Two different  regularization condition at the  front of the
   current: a) thin prewetting film with thickness $h_f$ b) gas-filled
   region.}
 \label{C7-Sketch}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
In particular, in a Cartesian geometry, they show that
\begin{eqnarray}
 h_0&\propto& h_f^{-1/7}\nu^{-2/7}L^{10/7}~(\text{Thin film})\\
 h_0&\propto& \sigma^{1/9}\nu^{-2/9}L^{14/9}~(\text{Fluid lag})
\end{eqnarray}
where $L$  is the half length  of the flow, $-\sigma$  is the constant
negative  pressure  in  the  fluid   lag  and  we  have  rescaled  the
characteristic    thickness    and     time    by    $\nu^{1/4}$    in
\citet{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.   As    expected,   the    two   different
regularization conditions lead  to only minor change  in the thickness
to length relationship ($10/7\sim 1.4$, $14/9\sim 1.5 $).

A rigorous  treatment of the front  can thus be taken  to provide only
higher-order corrections to the leading order behavior captured by the
models  developed   in  this  manuscript.  Nevertheless,   a  complete
description of  the dynamics of  the cooling gas-filled  region, where
the  pressure is  not  a parameter  but self-consistently  determined,
along with an  appropriate fracture condition at the  tip would surely
complete the description provided in this thesis.


\section{Further model improvements}
\label{sec:generalization-model}

\subsubsection*{Heat budget}
\label{subsubsection}

The theoretical  model for the cooling  elastic-plated gravity current
assumes that the  initial wall rock temperature is equal  to the magma
solidus,  i.e.   $\sim 700  \celsius$  for  a felsic  composition  and
$\sim 1000 \celsius$ for more mafic lavas.  The geothermal gradient is
$\sim 30 \celsius$ km$^{-1}$ in the upper crust and these temperatures
are  large  in comparison  to  the  expected temperature  for  typical
intrusion   depth;   for   instance,   the   temperature   should   be
$\sim  150 \celsius$  initially for  an intrusion  $5$ km  deep.  This
effect might enhance the cooling  and, especially in the early bending
regime, accelerate the phase transitions.

Viscous heating  is another mechanism  not taken into account  in this
study   that  would   participate   to  the   global  intrusion   heat
budget. Indeed,  especially for  large values of  $Pe$, where  we have
shown  that  the  flow  vertical  temperature  gradient  are  stronger
(Section  \ref{C4-sec:infl-therm-bound-el}),  the  effect  of  viscous
heating could  be important.  \citet{Costa:2005bq} have  already shown
that viscous heating plays an important role in the dynamics of fluids
with strongly temperature-dependent viscosity. In particular, for lava
tubes, they show that the  heat generated by viscous friction produces
a local  temperature increase  near the tube  walls with  a consequent
decrease  of   the  viscosity   which  may  dramatically   change  the
temperature             and              velocity             profiles
\citep{Costa:2002cj,Costa:2003wk,Costa:2005bq}.      The     important
gradients within  the thermal boundary  layers or near the  tip region
could  present  favorable  conditions  for  the  development  of  such
instabilities.

\subsubsection*{Stretching of the upper layer}
\label{subsubsection}

If the thickness of the intrusion  $h_0$ becomes large compared to the
intrusion depth $d_0$, the  analysis described in Chapter \ref{C3-JFM}
and \ref{Heating} is not valid anymore. For large injection rate, this
could happen for very shallow  felsic intrusions ($d_0\le 500$ m).  In
such situation,  the stretching of  the upper  layer can no  longer be
neglected when calculating  the elastic stresses which  can be derived
using the Föppl-von Kármán equation.

    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Baula.eps}
    \caption{Felsic laccolith, named Baula, in West Island. Modified
      from \citet{Anonymous:jHnLP36x}.}
    \label{C7-Baula}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

A  complete  description  of  the  flow  in  both  axysimmetrical  and
cartesian geometries, along with scaling laws for $h_0(t)$ and $R(t)$,
has    already   been    described   by    \citet{Lister:2013ia}   and
\citet{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV} respectively.  While the time dependence of
the  scaling  laws are  similar  from  those  derived in  the  bending
dominated regime, the shape of the  flow is not bell-shaped anymore in
the   early   time  solution   and   shows   somewhat  steeper   edges
\citep{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.    For   instance,    such   model   could
potentially explain  the shape of  some felsic laccoliths  observed in
Island by \citet{Anonymous:jHnLP36x} (Figure \ref{C7-Baula}).

\subsubsection*{Topography}
\label{sec:topography-1}

As shown in Chapter \ref{C5-chap6},  the topography also imposes large
constraints  on  the final  morphology  of  magmatic intrusions.   One
interesting avenue for research could be  to model the evolution of an
intrusion  intruding  a  volcanic  edifice.  The  model  developed  in
Chapter \ref{C5-chap6} could  indeed easily be adapted  to account for
the presence  of a conic volcanic  edifice instead of a  depression on
top of the  magmatic intrusion.  Such model, used  in combination with
the geodetic  measurements such as Interferometric  Synthetic Aperture
Radar  (InSAR)  imaging  and  GPS measurements  used  to  monitor  the
deformation on active  volcanoes, could provide a  useful framework to
understand  and  constrain the  dynamics  and  shape of  the  volcanic
plumbing systems (Figure \ref{C7-Volcano}).
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Manuscript/Figure/Chapter7/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{INSAR.eps}
    \caption{Radar  interferograms  of  Sierra Negra  volcano  showing
      uplift during  three time periods.   a, 1992. b, 1997.  c, 1998.

      from \citet{Amelung:2000ko}.}
    \label{C7-Volcano}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Similar studies could also be extended to caldera complexes which also
often record  ground deformations.   Towards more detailed  studies of
specific area, it could also be interesting to generalize the model in
$3$D. This  will allow to  account directly for the  object topography
one wants to  study and hence, make it easier  the comparison with the
available deformation measurements.

\begin{abstract}
  Temperature-dependent elastic-plated gravity  currents have numerous
  applications in nature, from shallow magmatic intrusions to the flow
  of melt-water below  an ice sheet. We develop  the general equations
  for an  elastic-plated gravity current with  a temperature-dependent
  viscosity for constant influx conditions.  We show that the coupling
  between  the  thermal  structure  and the  flow  itself  results  in
  important deviations  from the  isoviscous case. In  particular, the
  bending  and  gravity  asymptotic  regimes,  characteristic  of  the
  isoviscous  case,  both  split  into three  phases:  a  first  'hot'
  isoviscous phase, a second phase  where the flow effective viscosity
  and  thickness drastically  increase and  a third  'cold' isoviscous
  phase.  These three  phases  are  controlled by  the  extent of  the
  thermal anomaly, for  which we develop analytical  scaling laws. The
  effective flow viscosity  is governed by the local  thermal state at
  the current tip  in the bending regime while it  is the average flow
  viscosity in the gravity regime.  In the end, the complete evolution
  of such  an elastic-plated  gravity current  depends on  its thermal
  state at the transition between  the bending and gravity regimes. We
  provide  a  phase diagram  which  predicts  the different  evolution
  scenarios  as a  function of  the flow  Peclet number  and viscosity
  contrast.

\section{Introduction}

Elastic-plated  gravity  currents  involve the  spreading  of  viscous
material beneath  an elastic  sheet. The  applications range  from the
emplacement      of      lava      in      the      shallow      crust
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Bunger:2011cb} and melt-water drainage below ice
sheet  \citep{Das:2008in,Tsai:2010ev}  in  geological setting  to  the
manufacture of flexible electronics and microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS) in engineering \citep{Hosoi:2004dn}.

When  the thickness  of  the flow  is small  compared  to its  extent,
lubrication  approximation applies  and  the  study of  elastic-plated
gravity currents  resumes to  the study of  a sixth  order, non-linear
partial                      differential                     equation
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}   .   However,
the assumption  that the thickness of  the fluid tends to  zero at the
contact  line  leads  to  divergent viscous  stresses,  and  hence,  a
regularization     condition     is     needed    at     the     front
\citep{Flitton:1999iv,Lister:2013ia,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.   One  common
approach is to add a thin  prewetting film of fluid, thus avoiding the
requirement  for   any  boundary   conditions  at  the   contact  line
\citep{Lister:2013ia,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.

The dynamics  of the spreading  has been described in  an axisymmetric
geometry   for    a   Newtonian   fluid   with    constant   viscosity
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia,Thorey:2014cv}   and    show   two
distinct regimes of  evolution.  First, gravity is  negligible and the
peeling of the front is driven  by bending of the overlying layer; the
interior  is bell-shaped,  the radius  evolves as  $t^{8/22}$ and  the
thickness  as  $t^{7/22}$.   When   the  radius  becomes  larger  than
$4\Lambda$, where  $\Lambda$ is the  flexural wavelength of  the upper
layer, the  weight of  the current becomes  dominant over  the bending
terms    and   the    flow   enters    a   gravity    current   regime
\citep{Huppert:1982a}.  In this regime, the thickness profile develops
a flat top with bent edges,  the radius evolves as $t^{1/2}$ while the
thickness  tends to  a  constant.  Different  analogue experiments  of
isoviscous     flows     confirm     these     theoretical     results
\citep{Dixon:1987js,Lister:2013ia}.

However, in  many real geological settings,  the isothermal/isoviscous
assumption  are not  valid.  For  instance, the  viscosity of  magmas,
produced by partial  melting of the upper mantle, can  vary by several
orders    of   magnitude    \citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Lejeune:1995fc}.
Therefore,  as the  fluid flows,  it cools  down, its  composition and
crystal content change which, in  turn, modifies the viscosity and the
dynamics of the  flow.  Several studies have shown that,  in a gravity
current, this coupling between the cooling and the flow itself results
in     important    deviations     from     the    isoviscous     case
\citep{Bercovici:2007vc,Bercovici:1996uu,BALMFORTH:1999ey,Garel:2014era}.

In  this paper,  we examine  how  the spreading  of an  elastic-plated
gravity current is affected by  the cooling itself.  In particular, we
consider  the  problem  of  an elastic-plated  gravity  current  whose
viscosity depends  on temperature  according to a  prescribed rheology
$\eta(T)$.   This  gives rise  to  a  set  of two  coupled  non-linear
equations  that  we solve  numerically.   We  study the  flow  thermal
structure and its effect on the  dynamics through the rheology in each
regime separately.  In both regimes, we identify different ``thermal''
phases of propagation that we  characterize by different scaling laws.x

\section{Theory}
\label{C3-sec:theory}

\subsection{Formulation}
\label{C3-sec:formulation}

We model  the axisymmetric  flow of  fluid below  an elastic  layer of
constant thickness $d_c$ and above a semi infinite rigid layer (Figure
\ref{C3-Figure2-1}).   The assumption  that  the thickness  of the  fluid
$h(r,t)$ tends to zero at the  contact line leads to divergent viscous
stresses   and  to   the   theoretical  immobility   of  the   current
\citep{Flitton:1999iv}.   To avoid  problem  at the  contact line,  we
consider    a   thin    pre-wetting    film    of   thickness    $h_f$
\citep{Lister:2013ia} (Figure \ref{C3-Figure2-1}).

The  fluid is  injected continuously  at the  base and  center of  the
current  at  a constant  rate  $Q_0$  through  a conduit  of  diameter
$a$. The hot fluid is intruded  at temperature $T_i$ and cools through
the  top and  bottom by  conduction in  the surrounding  medium, whose
temperature is  considered constant  and equal to  $T_0$.  In  using a
fixed temperature at the flow boundary, we essentially assume that the
fluid is bounded by a medium with infinite thermal conductivity.

    \caption{Model  geometry and  parameters.  The  vertical scale  is
      exaggerated.}
    \label{C3-Figure2-1}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As  it  cools,  the  viscosity  of the  fluid  increases  following  a
prescribed temperature-dependent rheology $\eta(T)$ given by
\begin{equation}
  \eta(T)=\frac{\eta_h
    \eta_c(T_i-T_0)}{\eta_h(T_i-T_0)+(\eta_c-\eta_h)(T-T_0)}
  \label{C3-rheology}
\end{equation}
where $\eta_h$  and $\eta_c$  are the viscosities  of the  hottest and
coldest  fluid  at  the   temperature  $T_i$  and  $T_0$  respectively
\citep{Bercovici:2007vc}.    Although   this   rheology   is   largely
simplified,  the  inverse  dependence   of  viscosity  on  temperature
captures  the  essential  behavior  of  a  viscous  fluid,  i.e.   the
viscosity  variations are  the largest  where the  temperature is  the
coldest
\citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Marsh:1981dc,Lejeune:1995fc,Giordano:2008em}.

\subsection{Pressure}
\label{C3-sec:Pressure}

The  intrusion develops  over a  length scale  $\Lambda$ that  is much
larger than its thickness $H$ ($\Lambda >> H$).  In the laminar regime
and  in   axisymmetrical  coordinates  ($r$,$z$),   the  Navier-Stokes
equations within the lubrication approximaton are
\begin{eqnarray}
  -\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}  +  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\eta(T) \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right) &=&0\label{C3-V1} \\
  -\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}  - \rho_{m}g&  =&0\label{C3-Npressure}
\end{eqnarray}
where $u(r,z,t)$ is  the radial velocity, $\rho_m$  the fluid density,
$g$  the  standard acceleration  due  to  gravity and  $P(r,z,t)$  the
pressure within the fluid.  Integration of (\ref{C3-Npressure}) gives the
total  pressure  $P(r,z,t)$  within   the  flow.   When  the  vertical
deflection $h(r,t)$  of the upper  elastic layer is small  compared to
its thickness  $d_c$, i.e $h<<d_c$,  we can neglect stretching  of the
upper layer and only consider  bending stresses.  Therefore, the total
pressure $P(r,z,t)$ at a level $z$ in  the current is the sum of three
contributions: the weight of the magma  and of the upper layer and the
bending pressure
\begin{equation}
  P = \rho_m g (h-z)+\rho_rgd_c+D\nabla_r^4h
\end{equation}
where  $h(r,t)$ is  the flow  thickness, $\rho_r$  the density  of the
surrounding rocks and $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the thin elastic
layer, that  depends on Young's  modulus $E$, Poisson's  ratio $\nu^*$
and     on     the     elastic    layer     thickness     $d_c$     as
$D = Ed_c^3/\left(12(1-\nu^*)\right)$.

\subsection{Injection rate}

Assuming a Poiseuille flow within the cylindrical feeding conduit, the
vertical injection  velocity $w_i(r,t)$  and injection rate  $Q_0$ are
given by
\begin{equation}
  w_i(r,t)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{ \Delta P}{4 \eta_h Z_{c}} (\frac{a^{2}}{4}-r^{2})& r \le \frac{a}{2}\\
    0 & r > \frac{a}{2}
  \end{cases}
  \label{C3-eq12}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  Q_{0}=\frac{\pi \Delta P a^{4}}{128 \eta_h Z_c}
  \label{C3-eq11}
\end{equation}
where  $\Delta P$  is  the  initial overpressure  within  the melt  at
$z=Z_{c}$.

\subsection{Heat transport equation}
\subsubsection{Local energy conservation}

In the laminar regime and in axisymmetrical coordinates ($r$,$z$), the
local energy  conservation equation within the  lubrication assumption
is
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{D}{D t}\left(\rho_m C_{p,m} T+\rho_mL(1-\phi)\right)&=& k_m  \frac{\partial^2
                                                                T}{\partial               z^2}\label{C3-EnergyCons}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $T(r,z,t)$ is  the fluid  temperature and  $\rho_m$, $k_m$  and
$C_{p,m}$ are the  density, thermal conductivity and  specific heat of
the   fluid.   Here,   we   also  account   for   energy  release   by
crystallization of the fluid, which is a non negligible source of heat
for magmas; $\phi(r,z,t)$ is the crystal  fraction in the melt and $L$
the latent heat  of crystallization.  In this model,  the crystals are
considered only  as a source/sink  of energy as they  melt/form during
flow emplacement.  In particular, the physical properties of the fluid
are not modified by the presence of crystals.


Following a common approximation, we  assume that the crystal fraction
is a linear function of temperature over the melting interval
\begin{equation}
  \phi = \frac{T_L-T}{T_L-T_s}
  \label{C3-meltfraction}
\end{equation}
where $T_S$ and $T_L$ are the solidus and liquidus temperatures of the
magma \citep{Hort:1997hk,Michaut:2006di}. In  addition, we assume that
the fluid is  injected at its liquidus temperature ,  i.e. $T_L = T_i$
and,  for simplicity,  that the  solidus temperature  is equal  to the
surrounding rock  temperature $T_S  =T_0$. With  these approximations,
the local energy equation (\ref{C3-EnergyCons}) resumes to
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t}+ u\frac{\partial T}{\partial r}
  + w\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}  &=& \frac{ St}{St+1}\kappa_m  \frac{\partial^2
                                        T}{\partial               z^2}
                                        \label{C3-EnergyCons2}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $u(r,z,t)$ and  $w(r,z,t)$ are  the radial  and vertical  fluid
velocities, $St =\left(C_{p,m}(T_i-T_0)\right)/L$ is the Stefan number
and     $\kappa_m$     is     the    fluid     thermal     diffusivity
$\kappa_m = k_m/(\rho_m C_{p,m})$.  We  use an integral balance method
to solve the heat transport equation (\ref{C3-EnergyCons2}).  This theory
is based  on the  integral-balance method  of heat-transfer  theory of
\citet{Goodman:1958ue},  in  which  the   vertical  structure  of  the
temperature field  is represented  by a known  function of  depth that
approximates the expected solution.

\subsubsection{Integral   balance   solution   for   the   temperature
  $T(r,z,t)$}

Following \citet{BALMFORTH:1999ey},  we model the cooling  of the flow
through  the  growth  of  two thermal  boundary  layers:  one  growing
downward from the  top and a second growing upward  from the base.  As
we consider homogeneous thermal  properties for the surrounding rocks,
we assume that the two  thermal boundary layers grow symmetrically and
have the  same thickness  $\delta(r,t)$ (Figure  \ref{C3-Figure2-1}).  We
use the  following approximation for the  vertical temperature profile
$T(r,z,t)$
\begin{equation}
  T=
  \begin{cases}
    T_b - (T_b-T_0)(1-\frac{z}{\delta})^2 & 0 \le z\le \delta \\
    T_b & \delta \le z\le h-\delta \\
    T_b - (T_b-T_0)(1-\frac{h-z}{\delta})^2 & h-\delta \le z\le h\\
  \end{cases}
  \label{C3-Temperature}
\end{equation}
where $T_b(r,t)$  is the temperature at  the center of the  flow.  The
integral balance  solution in  (\ref{C3-Temperature}) assumes  a symmetry
around $z=h/2$  and a decrease of  the temperature in the  two thermal
boundary  layers  down  to  the  surrounding  rock  temperature  $T_0$
\citep{BALMFORTH:1999ey}.    In  addition,   it   assumes  a   uniform
temperature  $T_b$ in  between the  thermal boundary  layers.  As  the
fluid is  injected at  temperature $T_i$, we  have $T_b(r,t)  =T_i$ as
long as  $\delta<h/2$ (Figure  \ref{C3-Figure2-1}).  However, if  the two
thermal boundary layers connect, then $\delta = h/2$ and $T_b\le T_i$.
This profile assures  the continuity of the temperature  and heat flux
within the flow.


\subsubsection{Integral balance equation}
\label{C3-sec:integr-balance-equat}

We  begin  by  integrating  the  local  energy  conservation  equation
(\ref{C3-EnergyCons2}) separately  over the two thermal  boundary layers.
The integration  over the  bottom thermal layer,  i.e. from  the base,
$z=0$ to a level $z = \delta$ gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  &&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \delta( \bar{T}-T_b)\right)+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\delta(\overline{uT}-\bar{u}T_b)\right) + \delta\left( \frac{\partial T_b}{\partial t}+ \overline{u}\frac{\partial T_b}{\partial r}\right)\nonumber\\
  &=&-\frac{\kappa_m}{1+St}\left. \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\right|_{z=0}+w_{i}(T_{i}-T_b)
      \label{C3-Local1}
\end{eqnarray}
where the bars  indicate the vertical average over  the bottom thermal
boundary layer
\begin{equation}
  \overline{f} = \frac{1}{\delta}\int_0^{\delta}f dz\nonumber,
\end{equation}
which will be determined once the horizontal flow velocity is derived,
$T_b(r,t)$  is  the  temperature  at  $z=\delta$,  $w_{i}(r)$  is  the
vertical  injection velocity  and  we  have used  the  nullity of  the
thermal gradient at $z=\delta$ and the local mass conservation
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial ru}{\partial r} +\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}=0.
  \label{C3-MassConservation}
\end{equation}
The  integration over  the top  thermal layer,  i.e., from  the level,
$z=h-\delta$ to the top $z=h$ gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  &&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \delta( \bar{T}-T_b)\right)+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\delta(\overline{uT}-\bar{u}T_b)\right) + \delta\left(\frac{\partial T_b}{\partial t}+ \overline{u}\frac{\partial T_b}{\partial r}\right)\nonumber\\
  &=&\frac{\kappa_m}{1+St^{-1}}\left. \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\right|_{z=h}
      \label{C3-Local2}
\end{eqnarray}
where,    in    addition    to    the    local    mass    conservation
(\ref{C3-MassConservation})  and the  fact that  the thermal  gradient at
$z=h-\delta$ is  equal to  zero, we have  used the  kinematic boundary
condition in $z=h(r,t)$
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} +u\frac{\partial h}{\partial
    r} = w.
\end{equation}

Therefore,  the  heat  balance   equation,  i.e.   the  heat  equation
(\ref{C3-EnergyCons2}) integrated over the flow thickness, is obtained by
adding (\ref{C3-Local1})  and (\ref{C3-Local2}).   Using (\ref{C3-Temperature})
to derive the conductive fluxes, we finally obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
  &&\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left( \delta( \bar{T}-T_b)\right)+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\delta(\overline{uT}-\bar{u}T_b)\right) + \delta\left( \frac{\partial T_b}{\partial t}+ \overline{u}\frac{\partial T_b}{\partial r}\right)\nonumber\\
  &=&-\frac{2\kappa_m}{(1+St^{-1})}\frac{\left( T_b - T_0\right)}{\delta}+\frac{w_{i}}{2}(T_{i}-T_b).
      \label{C3-LocalHeat3}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Equation of motion}
\label{C3-sec:equation-motion}

A global statement of mass conservation gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+ \frac{1}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial
  r} \left( r\int_0^hudz\right)= w_i.
  \label{C3-C3}
\end{eqnarray}
To obtain an  equation for the flow thickness, we  first note that the
chosen vertical structure of the temperature field (\ref{C3-Temperature})
is symmetric  around $h/2$, and  thus, because the  boundary condition
are  the same  at  $z=0$ and  $z=h$, the  viscosity  and velocity  $u$
possess  the same  symmetry.  Taking  advantage of  this symmetry,  we
integrate              once              (\ref{C3-V1})              using
$\left.\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right|_{z=h/2}=0$ to get
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial   u}{\partial   z}   =   \frac{1}{\eta(z)}\frac{\partial
    P}{\partial r}\left(z-\frac{h}{2}\right).
  \label{C3-deriv}
\end{equation}
Using no-slip  boundary conditions at  the top  and the bottom  of the
flow, i.e.  $u(r,z=0,t)=u(r,z=h,t)=0$, (\ref{C3-C3}) can be rewritten as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial
  r} \left( r\int_0^h\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}zdz\right) + w_i.
  \label{C3-Mass}
\end{eqnarray}
Finally,  injecting (\ref{C3-deriv})  into  (\ref{C3-Mass}) gives  the
equation for the flow thickness evolution in axisymmetric coordinates
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\left(\rho_m g \frac{\partial h}{\partial      r}+D\frac{\partial}{\partial      r}\left(\nabla_r^4h\right)\right)\left(\int_0^h\frac{1}{\eta(y)}\left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)ydy\right)\right)
  + w_i.
  \label{C3-Mass-2}
\end{eqnarray}
In  addition,  integration  of   (\ref{C3-deriv})  using  the  no-slip
boundary condition at the base of the flow gives
\begin{equation}
  u(r,z,t)        =        \frac{\partial        P}{\partial        r}
  \int_0^z\frac{1}{\eta(y)}\left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)dy.
  \label{C3-udimensione}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\eta(y)} = \frac{1}{\eta_c}+\frac{\eta_c-\eta_h}{\eta_h\eta_c}\frac{T(y)-T_0}{T_i-T_0}.
\end{equation}
$T(y)$    being   a    polynom,   integrals    in   (\ref{C3-Mass-2}),
(\ref{C3-udimensione}) as well as  the averaged quantities $\overline{u}$
and   $\overline{uT}$    over   the   thermal   boundary    layer   in
(\ref{C3-LocalHeat3}) can easily be calculated.

\subsection{Dimensionless equations}
\label{C3-sec:dimens-equat}

We use the characteristic temperature interval $\Delta T = T_i-T_0$ to
nondimensionalize  temperatures.  The  dimensionless integral  balance
approximation (\ref{C3-Temperature}) becomes
\begin{equation}
  \theta(z)=
  \begin{cases}
    \Theta_b\left(1 -(1-\frac{z}{\delta})^2\right)& 0 \le z\le \delta \\
    \Theta_b & \delta \le z\le h-\delta \\
    \Theta_b\left(1-(1-\frac{h-z}{\delta})^2\right)  &   h-\delta  \le
    z\le h
  \end{cases}
  \label{C3-Temperature2}
\end{equation}
where   $\theta(r,z,t)$   is   the   dimensionless   temperature   and
$\Theta_b=\frac{T_b-T_0}{T_{i}-T_0}$.         Finally,       equations
(\ref{C3-LocalHeat3}) and (\ref{C3-Mass-2})  are nondimensionalized using
a horizontal  scale $\Lambda$, a vertical  scale $H$ and a  time scale
$\tau$ given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Lambda &=& \left(\frac{D}{\rho_m g}\right)^{1/4}\label{C3-L1}\\
  H&=&\left       (\frac{12\eta_h      Q_{0}}{\rho_{m}g       \pi}\right      )
       ^{1/4} \label{C3-H1}\\
  \tau&=&\frac{\pi \Lambda^{2} H}{Q_{0}}\label{C3-T1}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $\Lambda$  represents  the  flexural wavelength  of  the  upper
elastic layer \citep{Michaut:2011kg}, $H$ the characteristic thickness
of an isoviscous constant flux gravity current with viscosity $\eta_h$
\citep{Huppert:1982wr} and $\tau$ the characteristic time to fill up a
cylindrical flow of  radius $\Lambda$ and thickness $H$  at a constant
rate $Q_0$.   In addition, we  can define a horizontal  velocity scale
$U=\Lambda/\tau=\left(\rho_m           g           H^3\right)/\left(12
  \eta_h\Lambda\right)$ and a pressure scale $\rho_m g H$.

The dimensionless equations are
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}& =& \frac{12}{r}
                                    \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\left( \frac{\partial h}{\partial      r}+\frac{\partial}{\partial      r}\left(\nabla_r^4h\right)\right)I_1(h)\right)
                                    + w_i\label{C3-EqFinal1}\\
  \frac{\partial}{\partial

\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  I_0(z)&=&\int_0^z \left(\nu+(1-\nu)\theta(y)\right)\left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)
            dy \label{C3-I_1}\\
  I_1(z) &=& \int_0^z \left(\nu+(1-\nu)\theta(y)\right)\left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)y dy\label{C3-I_2}
\end{eqnarray}
and where $\gamma$, $Pe$, $St_m$  and $\nu$ are the four dimensionless
numbers that control the dynamics of the flow
\begin{eqnarray}
  \gamma&=&\frac{a}{\Lambda} \label{C3-gamma}\\
  Pe&=&            \frac{H^2}{\kappa_m            \tau}\label{C3-Pe}\\
  St_m &=& \frac{C_{p,m}\left(T_i-T_0\right)}{C_{p,m}\left(T_i-T_0\right)+L} \label{C3-St}\\
  \nu&=& \frac{\eta_h}{\eta_c}\label{C3-nu}
\end{eqnarray}
$\gamma$  is the  dimensionless radius  of  the conduit,  it does  not
significantly influence  the flow and is  set to $0.02$ in  this study
\citep{Michaut:2009jx,Michaut:2011kg}; $Pe$ is the Peclet number which
compares the vertical diffusion of heat to the horizontal advection in
the interior; $St_m$ is a  modified Stefan number which represents the
ratio  of sensible  heat between  solidus  and liquidus  to the  total
energy  of the  fluid at  the liquidus  temperature and  $\nu$ is  the
maximum viscosity  contrast, i.e.  the  ratio between the  hottest and
coldest viscosity.

\subsection{Further simplifications}
\label{C3-sec:furth-simpl}

\subsubsection{Heat equation}
\label{C3-sec:heat-equation}

In the  end, the  heat balance equation  (\ref{C3-HeatDimensionLess}) can
reduce to
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial
  t}\left( \delta( \bar{\theta}-1)\right)+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial
  r}
  \left( r\delta(\overline{u\theta}-\bar{u})\right)&=&- 2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\Theta_b}{\delta} 
                                                       \label{C3-HeatD_a}
\end{eqnarray}
Indeed, if  the thermal boundary layers  exist, $\Theta_b=1$, $\delta$
is  the  variable   quantity  and  (\ref{C3-HeatDimensionLess})  directly
reduces  to (\ref{C3-HeatD_a}).   In  contrast, if  the thermal  boundary
layers merge,  $\delta=h/2$ and  the variable quantity  is $\Theta_b$.
In  this case,  the  heat  balance equation  (\ref{C3-HeatDimensionLess})
reduces to
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h\bar{\theta}}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial
  r} \left( rh\overline{u\theta}\right)-\Theta_b\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial
  r} \left( rh\bar{u}\right)\right)&=& - 8St_mPe^{-1}\frac{\Theta_b}{h}+w_{i}(1-\Theta_b)
\end{eqnarray}
which, by using (\ref{C3-C3}), rewrites
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial h\bar{\theta}}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial
    r} \left( rh\overline{u\theta}\right) &=& w_i
  - 8St_mPe^{-1}\frac{\Theta_b}{h}.
  \label{C3-eqHS2}
\end{equation}
Equation  (\ref{C3-eqHS2})  also   corresponds  to  (\ref{C3-HeatD_a})  when
$\delta=h/2$.

Following \citet{BALMFORTH:1999ey}, we rewrite (\ref{C3-HeatD_a}) using a
new variable $\xi = \delta(1-\overline{\theta})$
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\bar{u}\xi\right)-\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( r\delta(\overline{u\theta}-\bar{u}\bar{\theta})\right)&=&2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\Theta_b}{\delta}.
  \label{C3-EqFinal2}
\end{equation}
where our  unknown $\Theta_b$ or  $\delta$ can be  calculated directly
from  the expression  of  $\xi$ using  $\delta  =h/2$ or  $\Theta_b=1$
respectively

\begin{tabular}{p{6cm}p{6cm}}
{
\begin{equation}
    \Theta_b(r)=
    \begin{cases}
      1 &\text{if } \hspace{.5cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \nonumber\\
      \frac{3}{2}-\frac{3\xi}{h} & \text{if} \hspace{.5cm} \xi > \xi_t\nonumber
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
                                   }
&
{
  \begin{equation}
    \delta(r)=
    \begin{cases}
      3\xi &\text{if } \hspace{.5cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \nonumber\\
      h(r,t)/2 & \text{if} \hspace{.5cm} \xi > \xi_t\nonumber\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  }
\end{tabular}

with $\xi_t = h/6$.

The second  term on  the left hand  side of  (\ref{C3-EqFinal2}) contains
advection by the vertically integrated radial velocity while the third
term contains  a correction accounting  for the vertical  structure of
the temperature field.  The  term on the right is the  loss of heat by
conduction in the surrounding medium.

\subsubsection{Average quantities}
The  average velocity  over  a thermal  boundary layer  $\overline{u}$
reads
\begin{eqnarray}
  \overline{u}        =\frac{1}{\delta}\int_0^{\delta}udz        &=&
                                                                     u(r,\delta,t) - \frac{1}{\delta}\int_0^{\delta}\frac{\partial
                                                                     u}{\partial
                                                                     z}
                                                                     zdz\label{C3-eqHello}\\
                                                                 &=&\frac{12}{\delta}
                                                                     \frac{\partial
                                                                     P}{\partial
                                                                     r}\left(\delta
                                                                     I_0(\delta)-I_1(\delta)\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $P(r,z,t) = h+\nabla_r^4h$ is the dimensionless dynamic pressure
and  we have  used (\ref{C3-deriv})  in (\ref{C3-eqHello}).   The average
rate  of heat  advected $\overline{u\theta}$  over a  thermal boundary
layer reads
\begin{eqnarray}
  \overline{u\theta}=\frac{1}{\delta}\int_0^{\delta}u\theta dz &=& \frac{1}{\delta}\left( [ uG(z) ]_{0}^{\delta} -\int_0^\delta
                                                                   G(z)\frac{\partial
                                                                   u}{\partial
                                                                   z}
                                                                   dz\right)\nonumber\\
                                                               &=&\frac{12}{\delta} \frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\left(G(\delta)I_0(\delta)-I_2(\delta)\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}
  G(z)= \frac{\Theta_{b} z^{2}}{3 \delta^{2}} \left( 3 \delta - z\right)
\end{equation}
is a primitive of $\theta$ when $z<\delta$ and
\begin{equation}
  I_2(z)=\int_0^z\left(\nu+(1-\nu)\theta(y)\right)G(y)
  \left(y-\frac{h}{2}\right)dy.
  \label{C3-I_3}
\end{equation}
Therefore, we have
\begin{equation}
  \overline{u\theta}-\overline{u}\overline{\theta}= \frac{12}{\delta} \frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\left(I_0(\delta)\left(G(\delta)-\delta\overline{\theta}\right)+\overline{\theta}I_1(\delta)-I_2(\delta)\right)
\end{equation} 
where  the  average  temperature  over a  thermal  boundary  layer  is
$ \overline{\theta} = 2\Theta_{b}/3$

\subsection{Summary of the equations}
\label{C3-sec:summary-equations}

In  the  end,  the  coupled  equations governing  the  cooling  of  an
elastic-plated gravity current are
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}-\frac{12}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial      r}
  \left( r I_1(h) \frac{\partial P}{\partial
  r}\right)
  \label{C3-HF}
  & =& \mathcal{H}(\frac{\gamma}{2}-r)\frac{32}{\gamma^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{r^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}\right)\\
  \frac{\partial                                       \xi}{\partial
  t}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial                          r}
  \left( r\left(\bar{u}\xi-\Sigma\right)\right)&=&2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\Theta_b}{\delta}\label{C3-TF}
\end{eqnarray}
with

\begin{tabular}{p{6cm}p{6cm}}
{
\begin{equation}
    \Theta_b(r)=
    \begin{cases}
      1 &\text{if } \hspace{.5cm} \xi\leq \xi_t \nonumber\\
      \frac{3}{2}-\frac{3\xi}{h} & \text{if} \hspace{.5cm} \xi > \xi_t\nonumber

    \end{cases}
  \end{equation}
  }
\end{tabular}
\begin{eqnarray}
  \overline{u}&=& \frac{12}{\delta}\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\left(\delta
                  I_0(\delta)-I_1(\delta)\right) \label{C3-ubarF}\\
  \Sigma     &=& \frac{\partial     P}{\partial
                 r}\left(8I_1(\delta)\Theta_b-12I_2(\delta)\right)\label{C3-SigmaF}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $P   =  h+\nabla_r^4h$   is  the  dimensionless   pressure  and
$\mathcal{H}$   the    Heaviside   function.    The    expression   of
$I_0(\delta)$, $I_1(h)$,  $I_1(\delta)$ and  $I_2(\delta)$ as  well as
the  numerical  scheme  used  to  solve  equations  (\ref{C3-HF})  and
(\ref{C3-TF}) are given in appendix \ref{C3-Numeric}.

\subsection{Preliminary results for an isothermal flow}
\label{C3-sec:prel-results-isoth}

For a  constant injection  rate, a  small pre-wetting  film thickness,
i.e.   $h_f<<1$ and  a viscosity  contrast $\nu$  set to  1, numerical
resolution  of (\ref{C3-HF})  shows two  asymptotic spreading  regimes
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia}.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/JFM_V13/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_Simple.eps}
    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless  time  $t$.   Dotted-lines: scaling  laws  in  the
      bending regime $h_0= 0.7h_f^{-1/11}t^{8/22}$  and in the gravity
      regime where  $h_0$ tends  to a constant.   Right: Dimensionless
      radius $R$ versus dimensionless time $t$.  Dotted-lines: scaling
      laws in the bending regime $R= 2.2h_f^{1/22}t^{7/22}$ and in the
      gravity current regime $R\propto t^{1/2}$.}
    \label{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_Simple}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

At  early times,  when  $R<<\Lambda$, gravity  is  negligible and  the
spreading dynamics is governed by the bending of the upper layer.  The
spreading  is  very  slow  and   the  interior  has  uniform  pressure
$P =\nabla_r^4h$.  The flow is  bell-shaped and its thickness is given
by
\begin{equation}
  h(r,t) = h_0(t)\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2(t)}\right)^2
  \label{C3-IntrusionShape}
\end{equation}
with   $h_0(t)$  the   thickness  of   the  current   at  the   center
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia}.       In       this      regime,
\citet{Lister:2013ia} have  shown that the spreading  is controlled by
the propagation  of a peeling by  bending wave at the  flow front with
dimensionless velocity $c$
\begin{equation}
  c=    \frac{d             R}{d            t}             =h_f^{1/2}
  \left(\frac{\kappa}{1.35}\right)^{5/2}
  \label{C3-WaveVelocity}
\end{equation}
where  $\kappa  =  \partial^2  h/\partial r^2$  is  the  dimensionless
curvature  of  the  interior  solution.   Using  the  propagation  law
(\ref{C3-WaveVelocity})   and  the   form   of   the  interior   solution
(\ref{C3-IntrusionShape}), \citet{Lister:2013ia} predicted  that, in this
regime, the flow radius and height evolve following
\begin{eqnarray}
  h_0(t)&=& 0.7 h_f^{-1/11}t^{8/22}\label{C3-ScalingH}\\
  R(t) &=& 2.2h_f^{1/22}t^{7/22}\label{C3-ScalingR}
\end{eqnarray}
where the numerical pre-factor obtained in our simulations match those
of \citet{Lister:2013ia} (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_Simple}).

In  contrast,  when  the  radius  R  becomes  larger  than  $4\Lambda$
($R>>\Lambda$), the  weight of the  current becomes dominant  over the
bending  terms.  The  pressure is  given by  the hydrostatic  pressure
$P =  h$ and  the current  enters a  classical gravity  current regime
where bending  terms only  affect the  solution near  the edge  of the
current  \citep{Huppert:1982a,Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia}.  In  this
second regime, the radius evolves as $t^{1/2}$ and the thickness tends
to a constant (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_Simple}).

In  the following,  we study  the effect  of the  cooling on  the flow
dynamics in  both regimes  separately. We  first describe  the thermal
structure  for an  isoviscous flow,  i.e. $\nu=1$  and then  study the
effect  of the  temperature-dependent viscosity  on the  flow dynamics
without  crystallization,   i.e  $St_m  =1$.  Finally,   we  introduce
crystallization by  setting $St_m<1$.  For simplicity,  we present the
results for a given  film thickness ($h_f=5\cdot10^{-3}$); results for
different film thicknesses are shown in Appendix \ref{C3-FilmThickness}.

\section{Evolution in the bending regime}
\label{C3-sec:evol-bend-regime}

We first concentrate on the case  in which only bending contributes to
the dynamic pressure.  The  governing equations are thus (\ref{C3-HF})
and (\ref{C3-TF}) where $P=\nabla_r^4h$.

\subsection{Thermal structure for an isoviscous flow, effect of $Pe$}
\label{C3-sec:thermal-structure-an}

The current  cools by conduction  and thermal boundary layers  form at
the contact with the surrounding  medium.  These boundary layers first
connect at the  tip of the flow, where the  small thickness induces an
important  cooling (Figure  \ref{C3-Grid_Time_ELAS}).  A  region of  cold
fluid forms at the front.

As the  current thickens  with time, a  balance between  advection and
diffusion of heat is never reached in the interior of the current. The
hot thermal  anomaly grows  in extent  with time  but slower  than the
current  itself and  the  cold fluid  region at  the  tip grows.   For
instance, for $Pe  =100$, while the region of cold  fluid extends over
about $10\%$ of  the current at $t=0.5$, it extends  over about $20\%$
at $t =10$ (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_Time_ELAS}).   The smaller $Pe$, the more
important  the  conductive cooling  and  the  larger the  cold  region
(Figure                    \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}                    and
\ref{C3-Thickness_Temperature_Profile_ELAS}).   For instance,  at $t=10$,
while the  cold region extends  over about  $20\%$ of the  current for
$Pe=100$,  it  extends  over  more  than  $70\%$  for  $Pe=1$  (Figure
\ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}).

\subsection{Thickness and temperature profile, effect of $\nu$}
\label{C3-sec:thickn-temp-prof-1-e}

When accounting for  the temperature dependence of  the viscosity, the
region of cold  fluid at the tip  is marked by a  higher viscosity and
enhances flow thickening at the  expense of spreading.  The larger the
viscosity  contrast,  the  larger  the aspect  ratio  $h_0/R$  (Figure
\ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}).  For  instance, for  the same value  of $Pe=1$,
while the aspect ratio is $0.7$ for  $\nu=1$ at $t=10$, it is $4.2$ at
the  same   time  for  $\nu=10^{-3}$   (Figure  \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}).
Nevertheless, the shape of  the flow remains essentially self-similar,
i.e.   well   described  by   (\ref{C3-IntrusionShape})  and   cannot  be
differentiated  from  the  shape  of  an  isoviscous  current  if  the
thickness and the radial coordinates  are rescaled by the thickness at
the     center     $h_0(t)$      and     radius     $R(t)$     (Figure
\ref{C3-Thickness_Temperature_Profile_ELAS}).

The flow thermal  structure is similar to the  isoviscous case (Figure
\ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}), the  thermal anomaly rapidly detaches  from the
tip of the  current and a region  of cold fluid develops  at the front
where  heat loss  is the  largest. However,  the important  thickening
induced by the viscosity increase limits heat loss to the surrounding.
The  larger  the viscosity  contrast  $\nu$,  the more  important  the
thickening and  the larger the thermal  anomaly at a given  time.  For
instance, for  $Pe=1$, while  the thermal  anomaly extends  over about
$30\%$ of  the flow for $\nu=1$  at $t=10$, it extends  over more than
$50\%$ for $\nu=10^{-3}$ (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}).

As expected, a larger Peclet number  leads to a larger thermal anomaly
(Figure  \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}).   However, although  different  Peclet
numbers cause very different thermal  structures, the influence of the
Peclet number on  the flow morphology is small, much  smaller than the
effect of the viscosity  contrast $\nu$ (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}).
For  instance, for  $\nu=10^{-3}$ at  $t=10$, the  thermal anomaly  is
still attached to  the tip of the  current for $Pe =  1000$ whereas it
makes about $50\%$ of the current for $Pe=1$; but, the thickness $h_0$
and the radius $R$ in both cases differ only by a few percents (Figure
\ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_ELAS}).   This  suggests  that,  in  this  regime,  the
spreading of  the flow is  not controlled  by the mean  temperature or
average viscosity of the flow.
  
\subsection{Evolution of the thickness and the radius}
\label{C3-sec:evol-thickn-radi-e}

In this  bending dominated regime,  the dynamics show  three different
spreading phases.   The thickness as  well as the radius  first follow
the   isoviscous   scaling   laws   for  a   hot   viscosity   current
$h_0\propto   t^{8/22}$  (\ref{C3-ScalingH})   and  $R\propto   t^{7/22}$
(\ref{C3-ScalingR}) (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS}).  In the second phase,
thickening  occurs at  the expense  of spreading  because the  thermal
anomaly  has detached  from the  current radius  and the  viscous cold
fluid  region at  the front  slows down  the spreading.   Finally, the
dynamics enters  a third phase  where the thickness and  radius follow
the  scaling  laws   for  the  spreading  of   an  isoviscous  current
characterized by a dimensionless cold viscosity $1/\nu$. These scaling
laws  are  obtained  from  (\ref{C3-ScalingH})  and  (\ref{C3-ScalingR})  by
rescaling  the characteristic  thickness and  time by  $\nu^{1/4}$ and
read
\begin{eqnarray}
  h_{0} & = &0.7 \nu^{-2/11} h_f^{-1/11}t^{8/22}\label{C3-ScalingH-Visco}\\
  R& = & 2.2 \nu^{1/11}h_f^{1/22} t^{7/22}\label{C3-ScalingR-Visco}.
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Scaling_HR_ELAS.eps}
    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless time  $t$ for different sets  $(\nu,Pe)$ indicated
      on      the      plot.      Dotted-lines:      scaling      laws
      $h_0=  0.7h_f^{-1/11}\nu^{-2/11}t^{8/22}$ for  $\nu  = 1.0$  and
      $0.001$.  Right:  Dimensionless radius $R$  versus dimensionless

      $\nu = 1.0$ and $0.001$.}
    \label{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
The dependence on  the viscosity contrast $\nu$ indeed  fits very well
the  third phase  of the  flow observed  in the  numerical simulations
(Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS}).   In the end, the  effective viscosity
$\eta_e$ of  the flow evolves from  the viscosity of the  hot fluid in
the first phase to asymptotically tend to the one of the cold fluid in
the third phase.

The time  the flow spends in  each phase depends on  the Peclet number
$Pe$.  For instance,  for $\nu=10^{-3}$, while the  current leaves the
first phase at $t \sim 10^{-6}$ for $Pe =1.0$, this transition happens
only   after   $t   \sim   10^{-2}$    for   $Pe   =   10^3$   (Figure
\ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS}).   The  larger  the  Peclet  number,  the  less
efficient the  cooling and  thus the  longer the  flow remains  in the
first phase and the later it reaches the third phase.

\subsection{Characterization of the thermal anomaly}
\label{C3-sec:char-therm-anom-e}

Following \citet{Garel:2012bh},  we quantify  the size of  the thermal
anomaly  through   a  critical  thermal  radius   $R_c(t)$  where  the
temperature  at the  center of  the flow  $\Theta_b$ is  $1\%$ of  the
injection temperature,  i.e.  $\Theta_b(r=0)-\Theta_b(r=R_c)  = 0.99$.
The thermal  anomaly is  first advected  at the  same velocity  as the
current itself,  i.e.  $R(t) = R_c(t)$  (Figure \ref{C3-R_Rc_ELAS} left).
After  a time  that depends  on $Pe$  and $\nu$,  the thermal  anomaly
detaches from  the tip and  $R(t)-R_c(t)$ increases with  time (Figure
\ref{C3-R_Rc_ELAS}) .

In  the bending  regime, the  interior  pressure is  constant and  the
thickness profile  $h(r)$ is  given by  (\ref{C3-IntrusionShape}) (Figure
\ref{C3-Thickness_Temperature_Profile_ELAS}). The  time evolution  of the
size of  the thermal anomaly  $R_c(t)$ is characterized by  looking at
the  radius in  the flow  where heat  advection locally  balances heat
loss, i.e.
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{d}{dt}\left(\Theta_bh\right)&\approx& Pe^{-1}
                                              \frac{\Theta_b}{h}\label{C3-Calcul1}.
\end{eqnarray}
Using  the thickness  profile (\ref{C3-IntrusionShape}),  (\ref{C3-Calcul1})
becomes
\begin{eqnarray}
  \alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2\left(\Theta_b\frac{d h_0}{d
  t}+h_0\frac{d \Theta_b}{d
  t}\right)+\frac{4h_0R_c^2\Theta_b}{R^3}\frac{d
  R}{d
  t}\alpha\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right) \approx \frac{Pe^{-1}\Theta_b}{\alpha^2\left(1+\frac{R_c}{R}\right)^2h_0}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where  $\alpha (t)=  \left(R(t)-R_c(t)\right)/R(t)$ is  the normalized
region   beyond   $r=R_c(t)$.    In  the   limit   $\alpha<<1$,   i.e.
$R_c/R\sim  1$,  the  time  derivative is  locally  dominated  by  its
advective part ($\propto \alpha$) and we finally get
\begin{equation}
  \alpha^3\approx \frac{Pe^{-1}} {h_0^2(t)}\frac{R}{\frac{\partial R}{\partial t}}.
\end{equation}
Substituting  $h_0(t)$ and  $R(t)$  by their  respective scaling  laws
(\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco}) and (\ref{C3-ScalingR-Visco}),  the size evolution
of the normalized cold front region $\alpha$ reads
\begin{equation}
  \alpha(t)&\approx& Pe^{-1/3}\nu^{4/33} h_f^{2/33}t^{1/11}.
  \label{C3-ScalingXi}
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to
\begin{equation}
  R(t)-R_c(t) = 2.1 Pe^{-1/3}\nu^{7/33} h_f^{7/66}t^{9/22}
  \label{C3-ScalingRRc}
\end{equation}
where the numerical prefactor, which  depends on the definition of the
thermal anomaly, has been chosen to fit the simulations.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/JFM_V13/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{R_Rc_ELAS.eps}
    \caption{Left:  Extent  of  the cold  fluid  region  $R(t)-R_c(t)$
      versus   dimensionless    time   for    different   combinations

      we   rescale  the   extent   of  the   cold   fluid  region   by

    \label{C3-R_Rc_ELAS}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The predicted scaling  law for the evolution of the  cold fluid region
(\ref{C3-ScalingRRc}) indeed  closely fits the numerical  simulations for
$\nu<1$ and for different Peclet numbers (Figure \ref{C3-R_Rc_ELAS}). For
$\nu=1$ and $Pe=1$, the condition  $R-R_c<<R$ is no more respected for
$t>0.1$, the thermal anomaly is much  smaller than the flow itself and
the   evolution    of   the   cold   fluid    region   diverges   from
(\ref{C3-ScalingRRc}).

\subsection{Effective viscosity of the current}
\label{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-e}

We  use  the   predicted  scaling  law  for   the  thickness  $h_0(t)$
(\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco}) to  infer the  time evolution of  the effective
viscosity  $\eta_e(t)$. Substituting  $\nu$  by $\eta_h/\eta_e(t)$  in
(\ref{C3-ScalingH-Visco}) and inverting for $\eta_e(t)/\eta_h$, we get
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta_e(t)/\eta_h&=& \left(\frac{h_0(t)t^{-8/22}}{0.7 h_f^{-1/11}}\right)^{11/2}\label{C3-eff-visco}
\end{eqnarray}
where $h_0(t)$ is given by the simulation.

      $t_{b3}$.  }
    \label{C3-Visco_ELAS_Version_2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As suggested  by the results of  section \ref{C3-sec:evol-thickn-radi-e},
the effective viscosity is first  close to the hot viscosity $\eta_h$,
i.e.   $\eta_e/\eta_h \sim  1$ (Figure  \ref{C3-Visco_ELAS_Version_2} a).
It rapidly  increases in the  second phase of propagation  and finally
tends  to  the  cold  viscosity  $\eta_c$ in  the  third  phase,  i.e.
$\eta_e/\eta_h \sim  1/\nu$. The  effective viscosity is  however very
different      from      the       average      viscosity      (Figure
\ref{C3-Visco_ELAS_Version_2} a).   Since the spreading is  controlled by
the propagation of a peeling by bending wave at the tip of the current
\citep{Lister:2013ia}, the evolution of the effective viscosity should
be linked to the rapid cooling  of the front. We calculate the average
viscosity $\eta_f(t)$ over a fixed front region of size $L$ in between
$R(t)-L$ and $R(t)$
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta_f/\eta_h =
  \frac{1}{V_f}\int_{R-L}^{R}\int_0^{h}  r  \eta(\theta)
  dr dz \label{C3-front-visco}
\end{eqnarray}
where $V_f(t)$ is the volume of this region.  The numerical evaluation
of $\eta_f(t)$ for  a constant size $L \sim 0.1$  fits relatively well
the evolution of the effective viscosity $\eta_e$ for the second phase
of propagation (Figure  \ref{C3-Visco_ELAS_Version_2} a).  Therefore, the
effective viscosity, and thus the different phases of propagation, are
controlled by the average viscosity of  a small region at the front of
size $L=O(0.1)$.

At the  initiation of  the flow,  the prewetting  film is  composed by
fluid at the injection temperature, the thermal anomaly is attached to
the front and the current spreads  with a hot viscosity $\eta_h$. Once
the  film  has  cooled  by   conduction,  which  occurs  over  a  time
$t_{b2}=0.1Peh_f^2$, where the numerical prefactor has been matched to
the simulations, the thermal anomaly detaches from the current tip and
the effective  viscosity starts  to increase.  Indeed,  when rescaling
the time  of the  simulations by  $t_{b2}$, the  different simulations
enter      the      second      phase      simultaneously      (Figure
\ref{C3-Visco_ELAS_Version_2}  b).   Then, the  size  of  the cold  fluid
region at the  front increases, the effective  viscosity increases and
the flow finally  behaves as an isoviscous current  when its effective
viscosity  becomes  close  to  its  maximum  value  $1/\nu$.   In  the
following, we use $\eta_e =  0.9\eta_c$ to determine the time $t_{b3}$
the   current   enters   this   third   phase   which   happens   when
$R(t)-R_c(t) \lesssim 0.5$.  Inverting (\ref{C3-ScalingRRc}) thus gives
$t_{b3}\sim  0.03  Pe^{22/27}\nu^{-14/27}h_f^{-7/27}$.   Indeed,  when
rescaling  the time  of  the simulations  by  $t_{b3}$, the  different
simulations   enter    the   third   phase    simultaneously   (Figure
\ref{C3-Visco_ELAS_Version_2} c).

\subsection{Note on the effect of crystallization}
\label{C3-sec:note-effect-cryst-1}

Here, we  examine the effect  of crystallization on the  flow dynamics
and  use   a  value   of  $St_m=0.17  <   1$,  relevant   for  magmas.
Crystallization  induces  a  release  of latent  heat  in  the  fluid,
increasing the amount of available energy at a given time.
\begin{figure}

    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless time $t$ for  different values of $St_m$ indicated

      law $h_0= 0.7h_f^{-1/11}\nu^{-2/11}t^{8/22}$  for $\nu = 0.001$.

      $\nu = 0.001$.}
    \label{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Stm}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
When $St_m<1$,  the tip of the  current remains hot for  a longer time
and the  flow transitions to the  second phase later than  in the case
where   $St_m=1$    (Figure   \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS_Stm}).     As   the
crystallization  acts only  to reduce  the  cooling term  by a  factor
$St_m$ in (\ref{C3-TF}), one  can easily rewrite (\ref{C3-ScalingRRc}) to
acount for the effect of crystallization on the size of the cold fluid
region
\begin{equation}
  R(t)-R_c(t) =2.1Pe^{-1/3}St_m^{1/3}\nu^{7/33}
  h_f^{7/66}t^{9/22}.\label{C3-ScalingRRcFinal}\\
\end{equation}
Indeed, the  dependence with the  dimensionless number $St_m$  is well
described   by  the   scaling   law  (\ref{C3-ScalingRRcFinal})   (Figure
\ref{C3-R_Rc_ELAS_Stm}).  Accordingly, the time $t_{b2}$ and $t_{b3}$ for
the  current to  enter the  second  and third  phase of  the flow  are
delayed when accounting for crystallization and respectively read
\begin{eqnarray}
  t_{b2}&\sim&0.1Pe St_m^{-1} h_f^2\label{C3-tb2}\\
  t_{b3}&\sim& 0.03 St_m^{-22/27}Pe^{22/27}\nu^{-14/27}h_f^{-7/27}\label{C3-tb3}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Evolution in the gravity current regime}
\label{C3-sec:evol-grav-curr-1}

To study the late time behavior, we concentrate on the case where only
the weight  of the fluid  contributes to the pressure.   The governing
equations  are thus  (\ref{C3-HF}) and  (\ref{C3-TF}) where  $P=h$.  We
follow the same framework  as in Section \ref{C3-sec:evol-bend-regime}.

\subsection{Thermal structure for an isoviscous flow, effect of $Pe$}
\label{C3-sec:thermal-structure-an-1}
  
As in the bending  regime, the bulk of the fluid  first expands at the
injection temperature and  $R_c(t) \sim R(t)$.  As the  bottom and the
top cool  by conduction, thermal  boundary layers form at  the contact
with  the   surrounding  medium  and   connect  at  the  tip   of  the
current. However, in the gravity  current regime, the thickness of the
current tends to a constant.  Therefore, conduction in the surrounding
medium rapidly balances  the input of heat at the  center and when the
thermal  anomaly detaches  from the  tip  of the  current, its  extent
reaches a steady state (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_Time_GRAV}).

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/JFM_V13/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Grid_Time_GRAV_Pe1_Nu1.eps}
    \caption{Snapshots of  the flow thermal  structure $\theta(r,z,t)$

      boundary layers.  Here, $\nu=1$, $Pe =100$ and $St_m = 1$.}
    \label{C3-Grid_Time_GRAV}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The  radius of  the steady-state  thermal anomaly  $R_c$ also  largely
depends on $Pe$ in this regime: the larger the number $Pe$, the larger
the radius  $R_c$ (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV}).  For  instance, while
the thermal anomaly $R_c$ is less  than $1$ in the steady state regime
for    $Pe=1$,   it    is   about    $12$   for    $Pe=10^3$   (Figure
\ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV}, $\nu=1$).

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Thickness and temperature profile, effect of $\nu$}
\label{C3-sec:thickn-temp-prof}

For a current with a viscosity that depends on temperature, as soon as
the thermal anomaly  detaches from the current radius,  the cold fluid
at  the  front tends  to  slow  down  the  spreading and  enhance  the
thickening of  the flow (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV}).   For instance,
for $Pe=1$, while the aspect ratio $h_0/R$ is about $0.12$ for $\nu=1$
at   $t=200$,    it   is   $\sim   1$    for   $\nu=10^{-3}$   (Figure
\ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV}).  The  shape of the current  is not self-similar
and the front  steepens when the viscosity increases  in comparison to
the isoviscous  case as  noted by  \citet{Bercovici:2007vc}.  However,
when the  current becomes  much larger than  the thermal  anomaly, the
current side slumps to become less steep (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV})
and  recovers  a  shape  similar  to the  isoviscous  flow  with  cold
viscosity.

The  thermal  structure  is  similar   to  the  isoviscous  case.   In
particular, after  a time  that depends on  $Pe$, the  thermal anomaly
reaches a  steady-state profile (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV}).   As in
the bending regime,  the thickening at the center limits  heat loss to
the  surrounding for  large values  of the  viscosity contrast  $\nu$.
Therefore, the  extent of the  thermal anomaly in the  steady-state is
slightly larger  for a larger  viscosity contrast.  For  instance, for
$Pe=10$ at $t=200$,  while the thermal anomaly extends  over less than
$2$ for $\nu=1$, it reaches $Rc\sim3$ for $\nu=10^{-3}$.

The flow  morphology is  much more  sensitive to  $Pe$ in  the gravity
current regime than  in the bending regime and different  $Pe$ lead to
different   current   morphologies   for   a   given   $\nu$   (Figure
\ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV}).   For instance,  for $\nu=10^{-3}$  at $t=200$,
the thermal anomaly is  still attached to the tip for  $Pe = 10^3$ and
the aspect ratio of the flow $h_0/R$ is close to $0.15$.  In contrast,
for $Pe=1$,  the thermal anomaly radius  $R_c$ is less than  $30\%$ of
the current  radius and the  aspect ratio of  the flow is  much larger
$h_0/R = 1.15$ (Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV}).

\subsection{Evolution of the thickness and radius}
\label{C3-sec:evol-thickn-radi-g}
  
As in the  bending regime, the dynamics in the  gravity current regime
shows three different spreading phases.   The thickness as well as the
radius  first follow  the  isoviscous  scaling laws  for  a given  hot
viscosity   $\eta_h$,   i.e.    $h_0$   tends  to   a   constant   and
$R\propto t^{1/2}$ (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_GRAV}).  In a second phase,
the  thickness  rapidly  increases   and  the  spreading  slows  down.
Finally, the thickness  and radius follow the  isoviscous scaling laws
but for a cold viscosity flow.

These dimensionless scaling laws read, as a function of $\nu$

  h_0 &=& 2.1\nu^{-1/4}\label{C3-scaling-H-gravi-2}\\
  R(t) &=& 1.1\nu^{1/8} t^{1/2}\label{C3-scaling-R-gravi-2}
\end{eqnarray}
They    perfectly   match    our    numerical   simulations    (Figure
\ref{C3-Scaling_HR_GRAV}).  Therefore,  the effective  viscosity $\eta_e$
that controls the flow dynamics is first close to the viscosity of the
hot fluid $\eta_h$;  it then rapidly increases  to asymptotically tend
to the viscosity of the cold fluid $\eta_c$ in the third phase.

As in  the bending regime, the  time the current spends  in each phase
depends  on $Pe$  (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_GRAV}).   For instance,  for
$\nu=10^{-2}$,   while  the   current  leaves   the  first   phase  at
$t\sim10^{-1}$   for   $Pe=   1.0$,  the   transition   occurs   after
$t \sim 10^1$ for $Pe=10^2$ (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_GRAV}). The larger
the $Pe$,  the longer the current  remains in the first  phase and the
later is reached the third phase.

\subsection{Characterization of the thermal anomaly}
\label{C3-sec:char-therm-anom-g}

The thermal  anomaly is  first advected  at the  same velocity  as the
current  itself, i.e.   $R_c(t)/R(t) \sim  1$ (Figure  \ref{C3-R_Rc_GRAV}
left).   After a  time that  depends on  $Pe$ and  $\nu$, the  thermal
anomaly detaches  from the  front and  reaches a  steady-state profile
(Figure \ref{C3-Grid_PeNu_GRAV} and \ref{C3-R_Rc_GRAV}).
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/JFM_V13/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{R_Rc_GRAV.eps}
    \caption{Left:  Normalized  thermal anomaly  radius  $R_c(t)/R(t)$
      versus   dimensionless    time   for    different   combinations
      ($\nu$,$Pe$) indicated on the plot.   Right: Same plot but where
      we rescale  the normalized thermal anomaly  radius $R_c(t)/R(t)$
      by $Pe^{1/2}\nu^{-1/4}$.}
    \label{C3-R_Rc_GRAV}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

We  develop a  simple  thermal budget  to predict  the  extent of  the
thermal  anomaly in  the  steady-state regime.   At  the steady  state
radius $R_c$ of the thermal  anomaly, a balance between heat advection
and diffusion in the surrounding medium in a dimensional form gives
\begin{equation}
  \rho C_p U_0 \frac{\Delta T}{R_c} \approx \frac{8 k \Delta T}{h_0^2}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta T$ is a mean  temperature contrast between the fluid and
the surroundings  and $U_0$ is  a mean  velocity of advection.   For a
gravity  current,  and  by  opposition  to  the  bending  regime,  the
thickness  $h_0$ reaches  a  constant. Taking  $U_0$  as a  horizontal
redistribution of the injection rate at $r=R_c$, we write
\begin{equation}
  U_0=Q_0/(2\pi R_c h_0)
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{equation}
  R_c\approx\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{\frac{h_0 Q_0}{\pi \kappa}}
  \label{C3-RcDimensionn}
\end{equation}
By non-dimensionalizing (\ref{C3-RcDimensionn}),  we obtain the evolution
of the steady-state radius $R_c \approx Pe^{1/2}\nu^{-1/8}$ and hence
\begin{equation}
  \frac{R_c}{R(t)} = 0.7Pe^{1/2}\nu^{-1/4}t^{-1/2}
  \label{C3-Scaling-Rc-Gravy}
\end{equation}
where  we  have  used   (\ref{C3-scaling-R-gravi-2})  and  the  numerical
prefactor, which depends on the definition of the thermal anomaly, has
been chosen to fit the simulations.

The scaling  law (\ref{C3-Scaling-Rc-Gravy})  closely fits  the numerical
simulations  (Figure  \ref{C3-R_Rc_GRAV}).    Indeed,  when  the  thermal
anomaly enters  the steady state,  the thermal anomaly  radius remains
constant  and  the  normalized thermal  anomaly  radius  $R_c(t)/R(t)$
evolves  as the  inverse of  the current  radius, i.e.   as $t^{-1/2}$
(Figure \ref{C3-R_Rc_GRAV}).  Furthermore, both  the dependence with $Pe$
and $\nu$ vanish when  rescaling $R_c/R(t)$ by $Pe^{1/2}\nu^{-1/4}$ in
the steady state regime (Figure \ref{C3-R_Rc_GRAV}, right).

\subsection{Effective viscosity of the current}
\label{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-g}

Repeating      the      same      exercise     as      in      section
(\ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-e}), we use the  predicted scaling law for
the  radius $R(t)$  (\ref{C3-scaling-R-gravi-2}) to  infer the  effective
viscosity $\eta_e(t)$ of the current
\begin{eqnarray}
  \eta_e(t)/\eta_h&=& \left(\frac{R(t)t^{-1/2}}{1.1}\right)^{-8}\label{C3-eff-visco-grav}
\end{eqnarray}
where $R(t)$ is given by the simulation.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/JFM_V13/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Visco_GRAV_2.eps}
    \caption{a)  Dimensionless viscosity  $\eta(t)/\eta_h$ defined  by
      (\ref{C3-eff-visco})  versus  dimensionless  time t  for  different

      dotted-lines:    average     flow    viscosity     defined    by
      $\overline{\eta_a(t)}/\eta_h                                   =
      \frac{1}{V(t)}\int_0^{R(t)}\int_0^{h(r,t)} r \eta(\theta) dr dz$
      where $V(t)$ is the  current volume.  b) dimensionless effective
      viscosity $\eta_e$ versus time where  the time has been rescaled

      time has been rescaled by $t_{g3}$ (\ref{C3-tg3}). }
    \label{C3-Visco_GRAV_2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As expected,  the effective  viscosity in  the gravity  current regime
represents  the average  viscosity of  the current  and the  different
phases of propagation reflect changes  in the average viscosity of the
flow (Figure \ref{C3-Visco_GRAV_2} a).

At the  flow initiation, the thermal  anomaly is advected at  the same
velocity  as the  current  itself  and the  current  spreads with  hot
viscosity $\eta_h$. When the thermal anomaly detaches from the tip and
enters a steady state, $\eta_e$ increases.  The time $t_{g2}$ to enter
this  second  phase scales  with  the  time  to  cool the  current  by
conduction,  i.e.  $t_{g2}=10^{-2}Pe$  where the  numerical pre-factor
has been matched to the  simulations.  Indeed, when rescaling the time
by  $t_{g2}$,  the  different   simulations  enter  the  second  phase
simultaneously (Figure  \ref{C3-Visco_GRAV_2} b).  Then, the  size of the
cold  fluid region  at the  front increases,  the effective  viscosity
increases and the  flow finally behaves as an  isoviscous current when
its effective  viscosity becomes close  to its maximum  value $1/\nu$.
As in  the bending regime, we  use $\eta_e = 0.9\eta_c$  to define the
time $t_{g3}$ the current enters the third phase of the dynamics which
happens        when        $R_c(t)/R(t)\lesssim0.3$.         Inverting
(\ref{C3-Scaling-Rc-Gravy}) thus  gives $t_{g3}=5.2Pe\nu^{-1/2}$. Indeed,
when rescaling the time of  the simulations by $t_{g3}$, the different
combinations $(\nu,Pe)$  enter the third phase  simultaneously (Figure
\ref{C3-Visco_GRAV_2} c).

\subsection{Note on the effect of crystallization}
\label{C3-sec:note-effect-cryst-2}

As in the bending regime,  crystallization induces a release of latent
heat, increasing the amount of available energy at a given time.
\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/JFM_V13/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Scaling_HR_GRAV_Stm.eps}
    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless time $t$ for different sets $(\nu,St_m)$ indicated
      on the plot  and $Pe=1$. Right: Dimensionless  radius $R$ versus
      dimensionless  time  $t$  for  the same  sets  $(\nu,St_m)$  and
      $Pe=1$.}
    \label{C3-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Stm}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
As a  result, when $St_m<1$, the  current is hotter on  average and it
transitions to the second phase later  than in the case where $St_m=1$
(Figure      \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_GRAV_Stm}).       As      in      section
(\ref{C3-sec:note-effect-cryst-1}),     one     can    easily     rewrite
(\ref{C3-Scaling-Rc-Gravy}) to account for  the effect of crystallization
on the thermal anomaly evolution
\begin{equation}
  \frac{R_c}{R(t)} = 0.7 St_m^{-1/2}Pe^{1/2}\nu^{-1/4}t^{-1/2}
  \label{C3-Scaling-Rc-Gravy_Stm}
\end{equation}
Indeed, the  dependence with the  dimensionless number $St_m$  is well
described  by  the  scaling law  (\ref{C3-Scaling-Rc-Gravy_Stm})  (Figure
\ref{C3-R_Rc_GRAV_Stm}).  Accordingly, the time $t_{g2}$ and $t_{g3}$ for
the current to enter  the second and third phase of  the flow are both
delayed and respectively read
\begin{eqnarray}
  t_{g2}&\sim&10^{-2}PeSt_m^{-1}\label{C3-tg2}\\
  t_{g3}&\sim& 5.2Pe St_m^{-1}\nu^{-1/2}\label{C3-tg3}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Different evolutions with bending and gravity}
\label{C3-sec:diff-evol-with-1}

For an  isoviscous flow with $h_f<<  h<< d_c$, in between  the bending
and  gravity  regime,  \citet{Lister:2013ia}  also  describe  a  short
intermediate regime where the peeling  by bending continues to control
the  propagation but  where  the flow  shows  an interior  flat-topped
region due  to the  increasing effect of  gravity. For  simplicity, we
only  consider the  two asymptotic  regimes.  At  the transition,  the
isoviscous current  is characterized by $R\sim4$  and for $h_f=0.005$,
$h_0 \sim 2$ and $t \sim 10$. In the following, we consider a modified
Peclet number  $Pe_m =  Pe St_m^{-1}$ which  integrates the  effect of
crystallization for clarity.

For a  current with a temperature-dependent  viscosity, the transition
between the bending regime and the gravity regime also occurs when the
radius    of     the    current    reaches    $R\sim     4$    (Figure
\ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_h}). However, the  current thickness and time
at the  transition depend on the  thermal state of the  flow, i.e.  on
the     combination    of     ($\nu$,$Pe_m$)    considered     (Figure
\ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_h}).   For  instance,  for $\nu=0.01$  and  a
small value of $Pe$, i.e.  $Pe  = 1.0$, the current transitions to the
gravity regime  at $t \sim  50$ with $h_0 \sim  8$ while in  the third
thermal phase  of the bending  regime. It  is then characterized  by a
cold viscosity  $\eta_c=100$ and a  large aspect ratio.   In contrast,
for a  larger value  of $Pe$,  i.e.  $Pe=  10^5$, the  current remains
longer in  the first phase of  the bending regime and  it spreads with
hot viscosity $\eta_h$ for a longer period of time.  As a consequence,
it  reaches  $R \sim  4$  and  enters  the  gravity regime  sooner  at
$t\sim 30$ while  in the second phase of the  bending regime and hence
characterized by a smaller thickness  $h_0\sim 5$ and a smaller aspect
ratio.   For  even  larger  Peclet  number  $Pe$,  the  current  would
transition while in  the first thermal phase of the  bending regime at
$t \sim  10$ and  with $h_0 \sim  2$, as in  the isoviscous  case with
viscosity $\eta_h$.

\begin{figure}

    \graphicspath{ {/Users/thorey/Documents/These/Projet/Refroidissement/Skin_Model/Figure/JFM_V13/} }
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_h.eps}
    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus
      dimensionless time  for different  sets $(\nu,Pe)$  indicated on
      the plot.  The grey line represents the isoviscous case $\nu=1$.
      Right:  Same   plot  but  for  the   dimensionless  radius  $R$.
      Horizontal  black dotted-line  represents the  transition radius
      between the bending and the gravity regime.}
    \label{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_h}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Overall, the time for the current to reach the transition $t_t$ is the
time for its radius  to reach $R(t)=4$. Setting (\ref{C3-ScalingR-Visco})
equal to $4$, we obtain $t_t=6.5(\eta_e/\eta_h)^{2/7}h_f^{-1/7}$ where
$\eta_e$  is  the effective  viscosity  of  the current  (see  Section
\ref{C3-sec:effect-visc-blist-e}).  In  particular, it is bounded  by two
values  corresponding to  two  end-member cases:  the  case where  the
current transitions to  the gravity regime while in  the first bending
phase, i.e.  when $\eta_e= \eta_h$  and $t_t^h \sim 6.5h_f^{-1/7}$ and
the case where the current transitions  to the gravity regime while in
the    third   bending    phase,    i.e.     $\eta_e=   \eta_c$    and
$t_t^c \sim 6.5\nu^{-2/7}h_f^{-1/7}$.  Indeed, when rescaling the time
of the simulation by $t_t^c$, the different simulations, for which the
third thermal phase of the bending  regime has been reached before the
transition to the  gravity regime, collapse on the  same curve (Figure
\ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_h2}, right).

    \caption{Summary of the different  transition times.  $t_t$ is the

      thermal phase, and $t_t^c$, when  the current transitions in the
      third  bending   thermal  phase.   $t_{b2}$   (resp.   $t_{b3}$)
      represents  the time  to  transition  from phase  1  to phase  2
      (resp. from phase 2 to phase  3) in the bending regime. $t_{g2}$
      (resp. $t_{g3}$) represents the time  to transition from phase 1
      to  phase 2  (resp. from  phase  2 to  phase 3)  in the  gravity
      regime. }
    \label{C3-tab:TimeTransition}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
The subsequent  evolution in  the gravity regime  also depends  on the
combinations ($\nu$,$Pe_m$)  considered.  Indeed,  in contrast  to the
bending regime where the effective viscosity is that of a small region
at the tip,  the effective viscosity is the average  flow viscosity in
the gravity  regime.  Therefore, the  effective viscosity of  the flow
can drastically decrease  when entering the gravity regime  and a flow
in the $i$th thermal phase of the bending regime can transition in the
$j$th thermal phase of the gravity  regime with $i\ge j$ which results
in  $6$ possible  scenarios.  For  instance, a  current in  the second
thermal phase of  the bending regime can transition into  the first or
second thermal phase of the  gravity current regime. However, the case
where  a current  in the  third thermal  phase of  the bending  regime
transitions to  the first thermal phase  of the gravity regime  is not
possible since the thermal anomaly  has already detached from the tip.
In the following,  we detail the five remaining scenarios  in order to
build a phase diagram as a function of the combination ($\nu$, $Pe_m$)
considered.


\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}

    \caption{Left: Dimensionless thickness at  the center $h_0$ versus

      third bending phase  (Table \ref{C3-tab:TimeTransition}).  The grey
      line  represents  the  isoviscous   case  with  given  viscosity
      $\eta_h$.   Right: Same  plot but  for the  dimensionless radius

      radius between the bending and the gravity regime.}
    \label{C3-Scaling_HR_ELASGRAV_h2}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

We  first consider  the  case  where the  current  transitions to  the
gravity regime  in the first thermal  phase of the bending  regime. In
that case, the time for the transition is $t_t^h$; it is less than the
time for the  second bending thermal phase  change $t_{b2}$; comparing
$t_t^h$    and   $t_{b2}$    gives    $Pe>65   h_f^{-15/7}$    (Figure
\ref{C3-Phase_Diagram_ELASGRAV},  Table  \ref{C3-tab:TimeTransition}).   For
$Pe>65 h_f^{-15/7}$, as $t_t^h<t_{g2}$, the current transitions to the
first thermal phase of the  gravity current regime ($B_1G_1$ in Figure
\ref{C3-Phase_Diagram_ELASGRAV}).

If the  current has already  reached the third thermal  bending phase,
the  transition  occurs at  $t_t^c$  and  is necessarily  larger  than
$t_{b3}$;      comparing      $t_t^c$     and      $t_{b3}$      gives
$\nu   >   8.3   \cdot   10^{-13}   Pe_m^{7/2}   h_f^{-1/2}$   (Figure
\ref{C3-Phase_Diagram_ELASGRAV},  Table   \ref{C3-tab:TimeTransition}).   As
$t_t^c>t_{g2}$ for  $\nu >  8.3\cdot 10^{-13}  Pe_m^{7/2} h_f^{-1/2}$,
the current can either transition to the second or third thermal phase
of the bending  regime.  If it transitions to the  second phase of the
gravity   regime,   then   comparing  $t_t^c$   and   $t_{g3}$   gives
$\nu    <    0.3Pe_m^{14/3}    h_f^{2/3}$    ($B_3G_2$    on    Figure
\ref{C3-Phase_Diagram_ELASGRAV}) and if it transitions to the third phase
of  the  gravity  current,   then  $\nu  >  0.3Pe_m^{14/3}  h_f^{2/3}$
($B_3G_3$ on Figure \ref{C3-Phase_Diagram_ELASGRAV}).

In  the case  where the  transition occurs  when it  is in  the second
bending  phase, the  time for  the  transition is  not exactly  known.
However, it  is bounded by  $t_t^h$ and  $t_t^c$ and we  can therefore
predict  some evolution  scenarios.   Indeed, the  transition time  is
necessarily smaller than $t_t^c$.   Therefore, if $t_t^c<t_{g2}$, i.e.
$\nu>7.0\cdot 10^9Pe_m^{-7/2} h_f^{-1/2}$,  the current transitions to
the    first   gravity    thermal    phase    ($B_2G_1$   on    Figure
\ref{C3-Phase_Diagram_ELASGRAV}).   Similarly,  if  $t_t^h>t_{g2}$,  i.e.
$Pe_m<650h_f^{-1/7}$, the  current transitions  to the  second gravity
current phase ($B_2G_2$ on Figure \ref{C3-Phase_Diagram_ELASGRAV}).

\section{Summary and conclusion}
\label{C3-sec:conclusion}

Isothermal  elastic-plated   gravity  current  shows   two  asymptotic
regimes.  At early times, the gravity is negligible and the peeling of
the  front is  driven  by  the bending  of  the  overlying layer.   In
contrast,  at late  times, the  own  flow weight  becomes the  driving
pressure and the current evolves in a gravity current regime.  In this
study,  we   have  developed  a   theory  for  the  evolution   of  an
elastic-plated gravity current with  a temperature dependent viscosity
and studied  the response of  the flow to  its cooling in  each regime
separately.

In the bending regime, since the flow constantly thickens, the thermal
anomaly grows with  time but slower than the flow  itself and a region
of cold fluid rapidly forms at  the front. In contrast, in the gravity
current  regime, since  the flow  tends to  a constant  thickness, the
temperature profile diffuses  to an almost stationary  profile and the
thermal  anomaly  reaches a  steady-state.   The  time to  reach  this
steady-state also scales with the dimensionless numbers of the system.
Analyses of the heat transport equation  in both regimes allowed us to
predict the  time evolution of this  thermal anomaly as a  function of
the dimensionless number of the system ($Pe$,$\nu$, $St_m$).

Numerical resolution of the equations  show that the combine of effect
of  cooling and  temperature-dependent viscosity  result in  important
deviations from  the isoviscous case.   In particular, each  regime is
split in three different phases: a  first phase where the flow behaves
as an isoviscous  flow with a hot viscosity, a  second phase where the
flow slows  down and drastically thickens  and a last phase  where the
flow returns in  an isoviscous flow but with a  cold viscosity.  These
three phases  are linked to  the coupling between the  thermal anomaly
and the flow itself and in particular, the second phase of the flow is
triggered by the detachment of  the thermal anomaly.  However, we show
that the effective  viscosity of the flow is  drastically different in
the two regimes.  While the dynamics  is governed by the local thermal
state of  the front in the  bending regime, it is  the average thermal
structure of the current that controls the flow in the gravity regime.

The  final evolution  of an  elastic-plated gravity  current therefore
depends on  the relative phase  change within  each regime and  on the
transition  between the  bending and  the gravity  regime itself.   We
provide a general phase diagram  that predicts the different evolution
scenarios as a  function of the dimensionless  parameters.  This model
for  the  cooling of  an  elastic-plated  gravity current  is  further
refined and apply to the observation in the next chapter.

\section*{Appendix A: Numerical approach}
\label{C3-sec:numerical-approach}

\subsection*{General procedure}
\label{C3-sec:general-procedure}

The coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (\ref{C3-HF}) and
(\ref{C3-TF}) are solved on a grid of size $M$ defined by the relation
$r_i =  (i-0.5)\Delta r$ for  $i=1,..,M$. The  grid is shifted  at the
center to avoid  problem arising from the  axisymmetrical geometry. We
index the grid point by the indice $i$ and denote the solution on this
grid  $h_i$ and  $\xi_i$ and  the secondary  variables $\Theta_{b,i}$,
$\Theta_{s,i}$ and $\delta_i$. Both equations  can be expressed on the
convenient form
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - f = 0
\end{equation}
where $u$  is the function we  want to integrate and  $f$ a non-linear
function  that depends  on $u$.   We  solve these  equations by  first
discretizing all the spatial  derivatives using Finite Difference. The
accuracy of the  scheme is determined by the  higher order derivatives
since  their numerical  approximation requires  the largest  number of
sample points.  We then get  two systems of $M$  ordinary differential
equations with the form
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial t} - f_i = 0 \hspace{1cm} i = 1,...,M
\end{equation}
The time derivatives are first  order and, since explicit schemes tend
to be  very sensitive and unstable,  we use a fully  implicit backward
Euler scheme to get
\begin{equation}
  \frac{u_i^{n+1}-u_i^n}{\Delta t} - f_i(u_i^{n+1}) = 0 \hspace{1cm} i
  = 1,...,M
  \label{C3-Num-1}
\end{equation}
Since  $f_i(u_i^{n+1})$ is  not a  linear function,  the system  above
cannot be re-arranged to solve $u_i^{n+1}$ in term of $u_i^{n}$ and an
iterative method  has to  be employed  instead. Fixed  point iteration
method have shown  poor results in converging toward  the solution and
we finally apply  second order Newton's method to  obtain the solution
at each time step.  In particular, we first linearize $u^{n+1}$ around
a guess  of the solution  by assuming $u^{n+1}=u^*+\delta  u^n$, where
$u^*$ is a guess and $\delta u^n$ is the error and we drop the $i$ for
clarity.   Then, we  expressed the  non-linear part  using a  Taylor's
expansion
\begin{equation}
  f^{n+1}=f(u^{n+1})=f(u^*+\delta
  u^n)=f(u^*)+J^h_{f}(u^*)\delta u^n\nonumber
\end{equation}
where  $J^u_{f}(u^*)$ is  the  jacobian matrix  for  the function  $f$
evaluated  in $h^*$.   Injecting the  expansion into  (\ref{C3-Num-1})
finally gives a  system of M linear equations for  the correction term
$\delta_h^n$ which can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  (I-\Delta tJ^u_{f}(u^*))\delta u^n=u^n-u^*+\Delta t f(u^*)
\end{equation}
where $I$ is the identity matrix. Therefore, each iteration solves for
$\delta u^n$ and we use $u_n+\delta u^n$  as a new guess $u^*$ in each
iteration. This  is repeated  until $\delta u^n$  becomes sufficiently
small.  Finally, since the equations are coupled, we use a fixed-point
iteration method  to converge  toward the  solution $(h,\xi)$  at each
time step.   Therefore, the  algorithm is the  following at  each time
step
\begin{itemize}
\item Start with a guess for the values of all variables.
\item Solve  the thickness equation (\ref{C3-HF})  for $h^{n+1}$ using
  Newton-Rhapsod method.
\item  Solve the  heat  equation (\ref{C3-TF})  for $\xi^{n+1}$  using
  $h^{n+1}$ as a new guess for $h^*$ and Newton-Rhapsod method.
\item Repeat  step one until  further iterations cease to  produce any
  significant changes in the values of both $h^{n+1}$ and $\xi^{n+1}$.
\end{itemize}
The computational scheme is summarized in the following.

\subsection*{Thickness equation}

The thickness equation (\ref{C3-HF}) is written as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}-f(h,\xi)&=&0
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  f& =& \frac{1}{r}
        \frac{\partial}{\partial      r}
        \left(      r  \phi\left(     \frac{\partial      }{\partial
        r}\left(h+P\right)\right)\right)+w_i\\
  \phi &=& 12I_1(h)
\end{eqnarray}
and where $P$ is the dimensionless bending pressure $P = \nabla^4h$.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Spatial discretization of f} \vspace{.5cm}

The  spatial discretization  is  obtained using  a central  difference
scheme  over  a  sub-grid  shifted  by $0.5\Delta  r$  from  the  main
grid. Therefore, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
  f_i&=&\frac{1}{r_i \Delta_r}\left(r_{i+1/2}\phi_{i+1/2}\left.\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\right)\right|_{i+1/2}-r_{i-1/2}\phi_{i-1/2}\left.\left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}+\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\right)\right|_{i-1/2}\right)\nonumber\\
     &=&A_i\phi_{i+1/2}\left(h_{i+1}-h_i\right)-B_i\phi_{i-1/2}\left(h_{i}-h_{i-1}\right)\nonumber\\
     &+&A_i\phi_{i+1/2}\left(P_{i+1}-P_i\right)-B_i\phi_{i-1/2}\left(P_{i}-P_{i-1}\right)\nonumber\\
     &+&w_i\label{C3-Num-3}
\end{eqnarray}
where                $A_i=r_{i+1/2}/(r_i\Delta_r^2)$               and
$B_i=r_{i-1/2}/(r_i\Delta_r^2)$.   The bending  pressure  term $P$  is
very stiff and  needs a careful treatment.  In  particular, the fourth
order derivative requires a fourth order central difference scheme and
therefore, $P_i$ is  expressed over a seven point stencil  on the main
grid such that
\begin{equation}
  P_{i}=   \alpha_{i}h_{i-3}  +   \beta_{i}h_{i-2}+\gamma_{i}  h_{i-1}
  +\lambda_{i}h_{i}+\kappa_{i}h_{i+1}+\delta_ih_{i+2}+\epsilon_ih_{i+3}
  \label{C3-Num-4}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  &\alpha_{i}&=\frac{1}{24\Delta r^{4}}\left(-4+3p_3\Delta_r \right)\nonumber \\
  &\beta_{i}&=\frac{1}{24\Delta r^{4}}\left(48-24p_3\Delta_r-2p_2\Delta_r^2+2p_1\Delta_r^3\right) \nonumber\\
  &\gamma_{i}&=\frac{1}{24\Delta r^{4}}\left(-156+39p_3\Delta_r+32p_2\Delta_r^2-16p_1\Delta_r^3\right)\nonumber\\
  &\lambda_{i}&=\frac{1}{24\Delta r^{4}}\left(224-60p_2\Delta r^{2}\right) \nonumber\\
  &\kappa_{i}&=\frac{1}{24\Delta r^{4}}\left( -156-39p_3\Delta_r+32p_2\Delta_r^2+16p_1\Delta_r^3\right)\nonumber\\
  &\delta_{i}&=\frac{1}{24\Delta r^{4}}\left( 48+24p_3\Delta_r-2p_2\Delta_r^2-2p_1\Delta_r^3\right) \nonumber\\
  &\epsilon_{i}&=\frac{1}{24\Delta r^{4}}\left(-4-3p_3\Delta_r \right)\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
and where $p_1=1/r_i^3$, $p_2=1/r_i^2$ and $p_3 = 2/r_i$. Finally, the
term $\phi_{i-1/2}$  and $\phi_{i-1/2}$, which depend  on the variable
$\Theta_b$, $\delta$ as well as  different power of $h$, are evaluated
in $i-1/2$ and  $i+1/2$ respectively. Different choices  for the value
of the variable at the mid-cell grid point do not show any significant
difference  and a  simple  average  is taken  such  that the  variable
$u_{i+1/2}$ is taken as $0.5(u_i+u_{i+1})$.

\vspace{.5cm}    \textbf{Expression   of    the   jacobian    $J_f^h$}
\vspace{.5cm}

The discretized  function $f_i$ can be  break down in three  part, the
gravitational part $f_i^{g}$  which is expressed in term  of the value
of $h$ on three  grid points $\left\{{i-1,i,i+1}\right\}$, the bending
part $f_i^{b}$ which is expressed in term  of the value of $h$ on nine
grid points  $\left\{{i-4,i-3,...,i+3,i+4}\right\}$ and  the injection
term which depends only on the grid point $i$ such that
\begin{equation}
  f_i = f_i^g+f_i^b+w_i
\end{equation}
Therefore, the jacobian is  nona-diagonal and its coefficient $J_{il}$
are
\begin{equation}
  J_{il}=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{\partial f^{b}_i}{\partial h_{l}} &
    l = \left\{{i-4,i-3,i-2,i+2,i+3,i+4}\right\}\\
    \frac{\partial       f^{g}_i}{\partial       h_{l}}+\frac{\partial
      f^{b}_i}{\partial h_{l}} & l =
    \left\{{i-1,i,i+1}\right\}\\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \label{C3-C2-eq12}
\end{equation}
The different  terms can be  easily derived from  (\ref{C3-Num-3}) and
(\ref{C3-Num-4}) with just slight  adjustment coming from the boundary
conditions.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Boundary condition} \vspace{.5cm}

We begin with  $h_i=h_f$ for $i=1,..,M$.  Since the  flow is symmetric
in $r=0$, we require that
\begin{equation}
  \left.\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}\right|_{r=0} =\left.\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\right|_{r=0} =0
\end{equation}
and therefore for $i=1$, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
  f_i     &=&A_1\phi_{i+1/2}\left(h_{i+1}-h_i\right)\nonumber\\
          &+&A_i\phi_{i+1/2}\left(P_{i+1}-P_i\right)\nonumber\\
          &+&w_i\label{C3-Num-5}
\end{eqnarray}
The expression  of the  bending pressure, evaluated  over a  $7$ point
stencils, is problematic close to the boundary and reflection formulae
will  be  used  in  order   to  accommodate  the  boundary  conditions
\citet{Patankar:1980vu}.   In   particular,  we  have  $h_0   =  h_1$,
$h_{-1}=h_2$ and  $h_{-2}=h_3$.  Similarly, boundary condition  at the
end of the mesh is accounted by using a grid much larger than the flow
itself and requiring
\begin{equation}
  \left.\frac{\partial h}{\partial r}\right|_{r=r_M} =\left.\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}\right|_{r=r_M} =0
\end{equation}
which gives for $i=M$
\begin{eqnarray}
  f_i     &=&B_i\phi_{i-1/2}\left(h_{i}-h_{i-1}\right)\nonumber\\
          &+&B_i\phi_{i-1/2}\left(P_{i}-P_{i-1}\right)\nonumber\\
          &+&w_i\label{C3-Num-5}
\end{eqnarray}
with $h_{i>=M}=h_f$.


\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Newton-Rhapsod method} \vspace{.5cm}

The Newton-Rhapsod method reads
\begin{equation}
  (I-\Delta tJ^h_{f}(h_k^*))\delta h_k^n=h^n-h_k^*+\Delta t f(h_k^*)
\end{equation}
where the  $k$ refers  to the $k$  iterations, $I$ is  a $M  \times M$
diagonal  matrix and  $J_f^h(h^*)$  is a  $M  \times M$  nona-diagonal
matrix.   This  system of  linear  equations  can  be solved  using  a
nona-diagonal algorithm. At the first  iteration, we use $h^*_1 = h^n$
as     a    first     guess    and     then    we     iterate    using
$h^*_k  = h^n+\delta  h_{k-1}^n$ as  a new  guess for  each iterations
until $\delta h^n_{k}$ becomes  sufficiently small.  In particular, we
require that
\begin{equation}
  \delta h^n_k/h^*_{k}<\epsilon
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$.

\subsection*{Heat equation}

The heat equation (\ref{C3-TF}) is written as
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial \xi}{\partial t}-g(h,\xi)&=&0
\end{eqnarray}
with
\begin{eqnarray}
  g& =& \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial                          r}
        \left( r\Gamma\xi\right) +\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial                          r}
        \left(r\Sigma\right)+2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\left(\Theta_b-\Theta_s\right)}{\delta}\\
  \Gamma&=& -\overline{u}
\end{eqnarray}

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Spatial discretization of g} \vspace{.5cm}

As for the thickness equation,  the spatial discretization is obtained
using  a  central  difference  scheme   over  a  sub-grid  shifted  by
$0.5\Delta r$ from the main grid. Therefore, we have
\begin{eqnarray}
  g_i &=& \left(C_i\Gamma_{i+1/2}\xi_{i+1/2}-D_i\Gamma_{i-1/2}\xi_{i-1/2}\right)\\
      &+&\left(C_i\Sigma_{i+1/2}-D_i\Sigma_{i-1/2}\right)\\
      &+&2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\Theta_{b,i}-\Theta_{s,i}}{\delta_i}
\end{eqnarray}
with         $C_i         =r_{i+1/2}/(r_i\Delta        r)$         and
$D_i =r_{i-1/2}/(r_i\Delta r)$.   We use the average  between the grid
point $i$ and $i-1$ (resp. $i+1$) to evaluate the quantity in $\Gamma$
and  $\Sigma$ at  $i-1/2$ (resp.   $i+1/2$).   In addition,  we use  a
classical upwind  scheme to handle $\xi$  at the mid grid  point which
requires
\begin{eqnarray}
  \xi_{i+1/2} &=& \xi_i\\
  \xi_{i-1/2} &=& \xi_{i-1}
\end{eqnarray}

\vspace{.5cm}  \textbf{Expression   of  the   Jacobian  $J_{g}^{\xi}$}
\vspace{.5cm}

The expression  of the Jacobian  is much straightforward in  that case
and its coefficient $J_{il}$ are
\begin{equation}
  J_{il}=
  \begin{cases}
    -D_i\Gamma_{i-1/2}&
    l = i-1\\
    C_i\Gamma_{i+1/2} & l = i \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \label{C3-C2-eq12}
\end{equation}
with only slight adjustment coming from the boundary conditions.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Boundary conditions} \vspace{.5cm}

We  consider $\Theta_b  =1$  and $\delta  = 10^{-4}$  in  the film  at
$t=0$. In this way, we ensure  that the average temperature across the
film at $t=0$ is close to $1$. By construction, $D_1=0$ and therefore,
for $i=1$ we have
\begin{eqnarray}
  g_i &=& C_i\Gamma_{i+1/2}\xi_{i}+ C_i\Sigma_{i+1/2} +2Pe^{-1}St_m\frac{\Theta_{b,i}-\Theta_{s,i}}{\delta_i}
\end{eqnarray}
For   $i=M$,   we    consider   that   $\Gamma_{i+1/2}=\Gamma_i$   and
$\Sigma_{i=1/2}=\Sigma_i$.   However,  the  choice  for  the  boundary
condition at the border of the grid $i=M$ is not important as we solve
the problem over a grid much larger than the flow itself.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Newton-Rhapsod method} \vspace{.5cm}

The Newton-Rhapsod method reads
\begin{equation}
  (I-\Delta tJ^{\xi}_{g}(\xi_k^*))\delta \xi_k^n=\xi^n-\xi_k^*+\Delta t f(\xi_k^*)
\end{equation}
where the  $k$ refers  to the $k$  iterations, $I$ is  a $M  \times M$
diagonal  matrix and  $J_f^h(\xi^*)$ is  a $M  \times M$  tri-diagonal
matrix.   This  system of  linear  equations  can  be solved  using  a
tri-diagonal algorithm.  As  for the thickness equation,  at the first
iteration,  we use  $\xi^*_1 =  \xi^n$ as  a first  guess and  then we
iterate using $\xi^*_k = \xi^n+\delta  \xi_{k-1}^n$ as a new guess for
each iterations  until $\delta \xi^n_{k}$ becomes  sufficiently small.
In particular, we require that
\begin{equation}
  \delta \xi^n_k/\xi^*_{k}<\epsilon
\end{equation}
with $\epsilon = 10^{-4}$. In addition, at each iteration the quantity
$\Theta^*_{s,k}$, $\Theta^*_{b,k}$  and $\delta^*_k$, that  are needed
to  evaluate $\Gamma$  and $\Sigma$,  are  derived from  the value  of
$\xi^*_{k}$  using (\ref{C3-TS}),  (\ref{C3-TB}) and  (\ref{C3-DELTA})
respectively.

\section*{Appendix B: Effect of the prewetting film thickness}
\label{C3-FilmThickness}

The divergence of the viscous stresses at the contact line imposes the
need    for    a    regularization     condition    at    the    front
\citep{Lister:2013ia,Flitton:1999iv,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.     In   this
study, we  show the  results for  a thin  prewetting film  of constant
dimensionless thickness $h_f = 5 ~ 10^{-3}$.

\begin{figure}

    \caption{Left:    Dimensionless    thickness   at    the    center

      $0.001$.}

    \caption{Left:  Extent  of  the cold  fluid  region  $R(t)-R_c(t)$

    \label{C3-R_Rc_ELAS_APPENDIX}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

However,   the    different   scaling   laws   derived    in   Section
\ref{C3-sec:evol-bend-regime} depends on the  film thickness $h_f$, as
confirmed  numerically  (Figure \ref{C3-Scaling_HR_ELAS_APPENDIX}  and
\ref{C3-R_Rc_ELAS_APPENDIX})  and  in  particular, the  phase  diagram
presented in section \ref{C3-sec:diff-evol-with-1} and its application
to the  spreading of laccolith  thus depends  on the chosen  value for
$h_f$.   The  meaning   of  the  prewetting  film   thickness  in  the
application  to  the  spreading  of  laccolith  is  unclear.  However,
reasonable values for $h_f$ are  values with physical significance for
this structural  length scale  at the  tip of  a laccolith  and should
range   from   a    few   centimeters   to   no    less   than   $0.1$
millimeter.  Therefore,  as  the  dependence with  $h_f$  is  weak,  a
variation of $2$ orders of magnitude does not change significantly the
results (Figure \ref{C3-PhaseDiagramJFM_Appendix}).

The  same  result hold  when  we  look  at  the relation  between  the
thickness and the  radius of the laccolith  (\ref{C3-Hr}). Indeed, the
best  fit  for   the  value  of  the  viscosity   contrast  scales  as
$h_f^{-1/2}$,  i.e.   $\nu_{\text{best}}=h_f^{-1/2}2.59~10^{-10}$  and
therefore,  varying  $h_f$ by  two  orders  of magnitudes  change  the
viscosity contrast by  one order of magnitude which  is acceptable for
our application.

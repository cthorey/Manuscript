\chapter{Isoviscous elastic-plated  gravity current model  for shallow
  magmatic intrusion}

\label{chap2} 
\minitoc

\citet{Michaut:2011kg} proposed  a new  model for  the spreading  of a
shallow depth intermediate-size intrusion, where magma is continuously
injected  at the  center and  is accommodated  by the  bending of  the
overlying strata.  In particular, the model differs from previous ones
by considering both the dynamics of the emplacement itself, in a sense
that the radius is self-consistently determined, and the driving force
associated with the magma weight. Both were neglected in older models.  In
the original paper from  \citet{Michaut:2011kg}, the model was derived
in  both cartesian  and  axisymmetric geometry  and  the results  were
presented  in  $2D$.  A  similar  model  in  $2D$ with  an  additional
fracture criterion  at the tip  of the  intrusion has been  derived by
\citet{Bunger:2011cb}    and   \citet{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}    discussed
more precisely the dynamics at the contact line and the case of an
elastic-plated gravity  current spreading over an  inclined plane.  In
this chapter,  we present a summary  of the model and  the results for
the spreading of an isoviscous elastic-plated gravity  current over a
rigid horizontal  surface in  an axisymmetrical geometry.   Results in
this geometry  have been  thoroughly studied  by \citet{Lister:2013ia}
and this model will constitute the reference for more elaborate models
in the manuscript.

\section{Theoretical model}
\label{C2-sec:model}

The model considers an isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current, i.e.
an  isoviscous  fluid  of  viscosity  $\eta_h$  and  density  $\rho_m$
spreading beneath a thin elastic sheet  of thickness $d_c$ and above a
semi infinite rigid layer \citep{Michaut:2011kg,Bunger:2011cb} (Figure
\ref{C2-Sketch}).  The fluid is injected  continuously at the base and
center of the current at a rate $Q_0$ through a cylindrical conduit of
diameter $a$.

\subsection{Governing equation}
\label{C2-sec:Governing equation}

\textbf{Driving pressure}\\

The  intrusion develops  over a  length scale  $\Lambda$ that  is much
larger than its  thickness $H$ ($\epsilon = H/ \Lambda<<  1$).  In the
laminar  regime  and  in  axisymmetrical  coordinates  ($r$,$z$),  the
Navier-stokes equations within the lubrication assumption are
\begin{eqnarray}
  -\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}  +  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\eta \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right) &=&0\label{C2_V1} \\
  -\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}  - \rho_{m}g&  =&0\label{C2-Npressure}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $u(r,z,t)$  is  the  radial   velocity,  $g$  is  the  standard
acceleration due to gravity and  $P(r,z,t)$ is the pressure within the
fluid.   Integration  of  (\ref{C2-Npressure}) thus  gives  the  total
pressure  $P(r,z,t)$ within  the flow.   When the  vertical deflection
deflection $h(r,t)$  of the upper  elastic layer is small  compared to
its thickness  $d_c$, i.e $h<<d_c$,  we can neglect stretching  of the
upper layer and only consider  bending stresses.  Therefore, the total
pressure $P(r,z,t)$ at a level $z$ in the intrusion is the sum of four
contributions: the  weight of the  magma and  of the upper  layer, the
bending pressure $P_b$ and the atmospheric pressure $P_0$
\begin{equation}
  P = \rho_m g (h-z)+\rho_rgd_c+P_b+P_0
  \label{C2-pression}
\end{equation}
where $h(r,t)$ is the intrusion  thickness and $\rho_r$ the density of
the surrounding rocks. The bending pressure  is given by the force per
unit area  that is necessary  for a  vertical displacement $h$  of the
thin elastic plate \citep{Turcotte:1982ca}
\begin{equation}
  P_d = D\nabla^4h
\end{equation}
where $D$  is the flexural  rigidity of  the thin elastic  layer, that
depends on the Young's modulus $E$, Poisson's ratio $\nu^*$ and on the
elastic           layer          thickness           $d_c$          as
$D = Ed_c^3/\left(12(1-\nu^*^2)\right)$.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Velocity field} \vspace{.5cm}

At the contact with the elastic sheet $z=h(r,t)$, the no-slip boundary
condition  hold and  then, the  tangential  velocity is  zero and  the
normal velocity  is the change  in height ($\partial h/  \partial t$).
With $\vec{n}$ the normal to the surface and $\vec{t}$ the tangent, we
have
\begin{eqnarray}
  \vec{n} \cdot (u,w) &=& \frac{\partial h }{\partial t}\\
  \vec{t} \cdot (u,w) &=& 0 \label{tangeant}.
\end{eqnarray}
The  tangent  vector is  $\vec{t}  =  (1,  \partial h/  \partial  r)$.
However, within the lubrication  assumption, the vertical component of
the  tangent  vector scales  as  $\epsilon$  and thus,  is  negligible
compared to  the radial  component. Therefore, the  boundary condition
($\ref{tangeant}$) reduces  to $u(r,z=h,t)  =0$.  At  the base  of the
flow, the same boundary condition hold and $u(r,z=0,t) =0$.

Equation (\ref{C2_V1}) is integrated twice  as a function of $z$ using
these boundary conditions and the horizontal velocity is
\begin{equation}
  u(r,z,t) =\frac{1}{2\eta} \frac{\partial P}{\partial r} \left(z^2-hz\right)
  \label{C2-vel}
\end{equation}

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Injection rate} \vspace{.5cm}

The effective overpressure $\Delta P^*$ driving the flow in the feeder
conduit decreases as the intrusion thickens and is given by
\begin{equation}
  \Delta P^* = \Delta P -\rho_m g h_0 \label{C2-Q0}
\end{equation}
where $h_0(t)$ is the maximum  intrusion thickness at the center $r=0$
and $\Delta P$ is the initial  driving pressure or the overpressure at
the base of the dyke ($z = -Z_c$).

In (\ref{C2-Q0}), the  bending pressure at the center,  which scales as
D$h_0(t)/R(t)^4$  where  $R(t)$  is   the  current  radius,  has  been
neglected.  Although  it tends  to infinity at  the initiation  of the
flow, it rapidly  vanishes as the current spreads  and the hydrostatic
pressure $\rho_m g h_0$ becomes  the main contribution to the pressure
at the  center.  In addition, the  model assumes a large  aspect ratio
for the flow and does not consider the initiation of the flow.

Finally,  assuming a  Poiseuille flow  within the  cylindrical feeding
conduit, the vertical injection velocity $w_i(r,t)$ and injection rate
$Q(t)$ are given by
\begin{equation}
  w_i=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{ \Delta P^*}{4 \mu Z_{c}} (\frac{a^{2}}{4}-r^{2})& r \le \frac{a}{2}\\
    0 & r > \frac{a}{2}
  \end{cases}
  \label{C2-eq12}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  Q = Q_0(1-\frac{\rho_m g h_0}{\Delta P})
  \label{C2-eq11}
\end{equation}
where
$Q_0=\left(\pi \Delta P^* a^{4}\right)/\left(128 \eta Z_c\right)$.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Mass conservation} \vspace{.5cm}

The fluid  is assumed  incompressible and a  global statement  of mass
conservation gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial         h}{\partial        t} +\frac{1}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial
  r} \left( r\int_0^hudz\right) = w_i
  \label{C2-Mass}
\end{eqnarray}
and using (\ref{C2-vel}), we find  that the equation for the evolution
of the thickness in time and space reads
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} =\frac{\rho_mg}{12 \eta r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial r}  \left( rh^3  \frac{\partial h}{\partial
      r}\right)+\frac{D}{12\eta r} \left( rh^3 \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\nabla^4h\right)+
  w_i .\label{C2-Heq}
\end{equation}
It is  composed of three different  terms on the right  hand side. The
first term represents gravitational  spreading, i.e.  spreading of the
current under its own weight. The second term represents the squeezing
of the  flow by the upper  elastic layer.  Both term  are negative and
induces spreading.   The last term  represents fluid injection  and is
positive.

\subsection{Dimensionless equations}
\label{C2-sec:dimens-equat}

Equation (\ref{C2-Heq}) is nondimensionalized using a horizontal scale
$\Lambda$, a vertical scale $H$ and a time scale $\tau$ given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Lambda &=& \left(\frac{D}{\rho_m g}\right)^{1/4}\label{L1}\\
  H&=&\left       (\frac{12\eta      Q_{0}}{\rho_{m}g       \pi}\right      )
       ^{\frac{1}{4}} \label{H1}\\
  \tau&=&\frac{\pi \Lambda^{2} H}{Q_{0}}\label{T1}
\end{eqnarray}

where scales  are chosen  such that $Q_0  = \pi\Lambda^2  H/\tau$. The
length scale $\Lamba$ represents the  flexural wavelength of the upper
elastic layer,  i.e. the  length scale at  which bending  stresses and
gravity  contributes equally  to flow.   The height  scale $H$  is the
thickness of  a typical gravity current  and the time scale  $\tau$ is
the  characteristic time  to  fill  up a  cylindrical  flow of  radius
$\Lambda$ and thickness  $H$ at constant rate $Q_0$.   In addition, we
can       define        a       horizontal        velocity       scale
$U=\Lambda/\tau=\left(\rho_m           g           H^3\right)/\left(12
  \eta_h\Lambda\right)$.

The dimensionless equation is
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}& =&\frac{1}{ r}
                                    \frac{\partial}{\partial r}  \left( rh^3  \frac{\partial h}{\partial
                                    r}\right)+\frac{1}{ r} \left( rh^3
                                    \frac{\partial}{\partial
                                    r}\nabla^4h\right)\nonumber\\
                               &+&
                                   \frac{32}{\gamma^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{r^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}\right)\left(1-\frac{h_0}{\sigma}\right)
                                   \label{C2-mainEq}
\end{eqnarray}
where the last term is replaced by zero for $r>\gamma/2$. $\gamma$ and
$\sigma$ are  two dimensionless numbers  that control the  dynamics of
the flow
\begin{eqnarray}
  \gamma &=& \frac{a}{\Lambda}\\
  \sigma &=& \frac{\Delta P}{\rho_m g H}.
\end{eqnarray}
$\gamma$  is the  dimensionless radius  of  the conduit,  it does  not
significantly influence the flow and is set to $0.02$ in the following
\citep{Michaut:2009jx,Michaut:2011kg}.   $\sigma$  is  the  normalized
pressure  head,  i.e.,  the  ratio between  the  initial  overpressure
driving the flow and the weight of the magma at the center.
	 
\subsection{Need for regularization}
\label{C2-sec:need-regularization}

One  of   the  main   mathematical  difficulty  in   solving  equation
(\ref{C2-mainEq}) arises at the  contact line.  Indeed, the assumption
that the  thickness of  the fluid  tends to zero  at the  contact line
leads       to       divergent      viscous       stresses,       i.e.
$\eta  \partial   u/\partial  z\rightarrow  \infty$  and   hence,  the
theoretical         immobility          of         the         blister
\citep{Flitton:1999iv,Lister:2013ia,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}. This problem,
known  a  the  contact-line  paradox,  is  a  well  know  problem  for
surface-tension driven flow  such as the spreading of  a water droplet
\citep{Bertozzi:1998wz,Snoeijer:2013cm}.

The formal proof  have been derived by  \citet{Flitton:1999iv} and can
be derived  as follow. Suppose  that (\ref{C2-mainEq}) has  a solution
and the solution has the  form $h \sim A(t)(R(t)-r)^{\alpha}$ near the
contact line.  As $r \rightarrow R(r)$, the bending term dominates the
gravitational term and (\ref{C2-mainEq}) reduces to
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial       h}{\partial       t}&      =&\frac{1}{       r}
                                                     \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( rh^3 \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\nabla^4h\right).
                                                     \label{C2-mainEq2}
\end{eqnarray}
Injecting the  solution into  (\ref{C2-mainEq2}) and keeping  only the
leading powers of $R-r$ gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial    R}{\partial    t}    A\alpha\left(R-r\right)^{\alpha-1}+
  \frac{\partial           A}{\partial           t}\left(R-r)^{\alpha}
  &=&A^4\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)\nonumber\\
  &&(\alpha-3)(\alpha-4)(\alpha-5)(R-r)^{4\alpha-6}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The time derivative is locally dominated by its convective part at the
tip, the second  term on the left  is small compared to  the first and
therefore, by equating the exponent of $R-r$, we obtain $\alpha = 5/3$
and then
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} =-\frac{280}{243} A^3.
\end{equation}
It  shows   that  (\ref{C2-mainEq})  can  only   have  solutions  with
retreating  contact line  ($dR/dt<0$) but  not with  advancing contact
line ($dR/dt>0$) \citep{Lister:2013ia,Flitton:1999iv}.

To  mitigate this  problem,  one  common approach  is  to  add a  thin
prewetting film, with thickness $h_f$  such that $h\rightarrow h_f$ as
$r\rightarrow  \infty$.   While  the  solution will  depend  upon  the
prewetting  film thickness  $h_f$ and  will not  show any  convergence
properties when $h_f\rightarrow 0$, we will see that the dependence in
$h_f$ is  weak and the  difference between different values  for $h_f$
will  be  relatively  small  \citep{Lister:2013ia,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.
Unless otherwise specified, we will consider $h_f = 5\cdot 10^{-3}$ in
the manuscript.



\section{Results}
\label{C2-sec:regime-propagations}

For a small  prewetting film thickness, i.e.   $h_f<<1$, the numerical
resolution of  the equation  (\ref{C2-mainEq}) shows  three asymptotic
spreading regimes:  a bending  regime where  gravity is  negligible, a
viscous  gravity current  regime  where bending  is  negligible and  a
regime               of              lateral               propagation
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Bunger:2011cb,Lister:2013ia}. In  the following,
we present the shape of the flow  as well as scaling laws that predict
the evolution of  the thickness at the center $h_0(t)$  and the radius
$R(t)$ in each regime.

      of the radial axis $r$ at  five different times indicated on the

      the characteristic  scales (thickness,  length or time  given by
      (\ref{H1}),  (\ref{L1})  or  (\ref{T1})) to  obtain  dimensional
      values.   For $t<10$,  the intrusion  is in  the bending  regime
      whereas  for $t>10$  the  intrusion is  in  the gravity  current
      regime.}
    \label{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Profil}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bending regime}
\label{C2-sec:bending-regime}

At  early times,  when  $R<<\Lambda$, gravity  is  negligible and  the
dynamics of  the spreading  is governed  by the  bending of  the upper
layer.   In addition,  if $h_0<<\sigma$,  the overpressure  $\Delta P$
driving the flow is much larger than  the weight of the blister at the
center and the injection rate can be considered constant.

In that case, the spreading is  very slow and the interior has uniform
pressure $P =\nabla^4h$.  The flow is bell-shaped and its thickness is
given by
\begin{equation}
  h(r,t) = h_0(t)\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2(t)}\right)^2
  \label{IntrusionShape}
\end{equation}
with  $h_0(t)$   the  thickness  of   the  intrusion  at   the  center
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia}.       In       this      regime,
\citet{Lister:2013ia} have  shown that the spreading  is controlled by
the propagation  of a peeling by  bending wave at the  intrusion front
with dimensionless velocity $c$
\begin{equation}
  c=    \frac{\partial             R}{\partial            t}             =h_f^{1/2}
  \left(\frac{\kappa}{1.35}\right)^{5/2}
  \label{WaveVelocity}
\end{equation}
where  $\kappa  =  \partial^2  h/\partial r^2$  is  the  dimensionless
curvature  of  the  interior  solution.   Using  the  propagation  law
(\ref{WaveVelocity})   and  the   form   of   the  interior   solution
(\ref{IntrusionShape}), they  find that the  radius and the  height of
the intrusion are given by similarity solutions
\begin{eqnarray}
  R(t) &=& 2.2h_f^{1/22}t^{7/22}\label{ScalingR}\\
  h_0(t)&=&0.7 h_f^{-1/11}t^{8/22}\label{ScalingH}.
\end{eqnarray}
where   the   numerical   pre-factor   have  been   matched   to   our
simulations. The bell-shaped morphology of  the flow in this regime is
very   close    to   the   dome-shaped   morphology    of   laccoliths
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}.

      scaling  laws in  the different  regimes.  Right:  Dimensionless

    \label{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Sigma}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gravity current regime}
\label{C2-sec:grav-curr-regime}

In  contrast, when  the radius  R becomes  much larger  than $\Lambda$
($R>>\Lambda$), the weight of the  intrusion becomes dominant over the
bending  terms.  The  pressure is  given by  the hydrostatic  pressure
$P = h$  and the intrusion enters a classical  viscous gravity current
regime where bending terms only affect the solution near the intrusion
edge   \citep{Huppert:1982a,Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia}.   In   this
second regime,  while the  thickness tends to  a constant,  the radius
evolves as $t^{1/2}$.  The flow  is therefore characterized by a small
aspect-ratio  and a  disk-like morphology  close to  the one  shown by
large mafic sills.

In between the bending  and gravity regime, \citet{Lister:2013ia} also
describe  a short  intermediate regime  where the  peeling by  bending
continues to control the propagation  but where, due to the increasing
effect of gravity, the flow shows an interior flat-topped region. This
flat-topped   morphology  is   also  observed   for  many   laccoliths
\citep{Koch:1981if,Bunger:2011cb}.

\subsection{Lateral propagation}
\label{sec:lateral-propagation}

Once $h_0\rightarrow \sigma$,  the flow is thick  enough to compensate
for  the initial  overpressure. The  thickness at  the center  remains
constant and  the flow enters  a regime of lateral  propagation, where
only its radius $R(t)$ is  to increase \citep{Michaut:2011kg}. In this
regime, except at the center when it redistributes the pressure over a
length scale $\Lambda$, the bending term is negligible compared to the
gravitational  term. \citet{Michaut:2011kg}  has  shown  that in  this
regime, the thickness is constant and the radius evolves as $t^{1/4}$
\begin{eqnarray}
  R(t) &=& \left(\frac{\sigma^3 t}{4\pi}\right)^{1/4}\label{Scaling-R-Propa}\\
  h_0 &=& \sigma\label{Scaling-H-Propa}
\end{eqnarray} 

\section{Application to the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions}
\label{C2-sec:appl-earth-moon}

\subsection{Observations versus predictions on the Earth}
\label{sec:observ-vs-pred}

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Dataset} \vspace{.5cm}

\citet{E:2015tl}  has made  an extensive  catalog of  $900$ laccoliths
across the  world.  In  particular, \citet{E:2015tl} provides  for the
thickness and  the radius  of $168$ laccoliths  among which,  $40$ are
also  given  with  an  estimation   of  the  intrusion  depth.   These
laccoliths, who are felsic in composition, show thicknesses that range
mainly from $100$ meters to $10$ km with radii in between $1$ and $10$
km.   While  most  of  the  data  are  located  in  the  United  State
($\sim 90\%$),  the different laccoliths  are widely spread  among the
territory and variation in the parameters between different laccoliths
is most likely to be important.
\begin{figure}[h!]

      formations. Figure modified from \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}.}
    \label{C2_Geological_Data}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Therefore,  in addition  to the  data from  \citet{E:2015tl}, we  also
consider in this  study the data provided  by \citet{Rocchi:2002jy} on
$9$ laccoliths  nested in a  christmas tree structure at  Elba Island,
Italy  (Figure \ref{C2_Geological_Data}).   The  detailed mapping  and
reconstruction  of  tectonic  history  made  by  \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}
provides for the  parameters of each intrusive layer  in the laccolith
complex. In  addition, for this dataset,  each laccolith is part  of a
larger intrusive system, and hence variability of the model parameters
should be limited,  except for the overlying  elastic layer thickness,
taken to be the intrusion depth, whose variation between laccoliths is
given by  \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}.  The  dispersion is much  smaller for
this dataset; the radius ranges from  $1$ to $10$ km and the thickness
from $40$m to $1$ km.

Finally, we  also account for  $25$ large mafic sills  whose thickness
and radius are given by \citet{Cruden:tg}. In order to account for the
intrinsic scale of  different settings for each  intrusion and compare
them to the model, the data  have first to be nondimensionalized using
characteristic  values for  each intrusion  parameters and  also their
depth, when absent from the catalog.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Range of value for the parameters} \vspace{.5cm}

In terrestrial settings, magma density  $\rho_m$ depends mainly on its
composition and varies between $ 2500$ kg m$^{-3}$ for felsic lavas to
$3000$ kg m$^{-3}$ for a  more mafic lavas.  Reported intrusion depth,
which is set to $1.5$ km otherwise,  varies from $180$ to $2200$ m for
the laccoliths in \citet{E:2015tl} and from  $1.9$ to $3.7$ km for the
laccoliths at Elba Island.  Hence, for a Young's modulus value of $10$
GPa, the characteristic length scale $\Lambda$ varies between $\sim 1$
km and $\sim  7$ km for laccoliths.  The density  does not affect much
the value of  $\Lambda$ and the characteristic length  scale for large
mafic sills,  whose depths are  not reported in  \citet{Cruden:tg} and
set to $1.5$ km, is equal to $\sim 3$ km.

On Earth, laccoliths are generally  formed by relatively evolved lavas
that  may have  differentiated from  primitive magma  in deep  crustal
magma chambers,  located some $5$  to $15$  km below the  surface. The
overpressures  driving magma  ascent are  typically $20$  to $50$  MPa
\citep{Stasiuk:1993kg,Barmin:2002ea},    which   gives    overpressure
gradients  of $\sim  10^3$ Pa  m$^{−1}$.  Lava  viscosity at  eruption
temperature  $\eta_h$  depends mainly  on  its  composition and  water
content; close to its liquidus  temperature, it can varies from $10^2$
Pa  s   for  mafic   lavas  to   $10^{5}$  Pa   s  for   felsic  lavas
\citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Giordano:2008em,Whittington:2009fv,Chevrel:2013jn}.
\citet{Wada:2007tv} show  that the dyke  width tends to  increase with
viscosity  to the  power $1/4$  \citep{Kerr:1995tl}; mafic  lavas with
viscosity $10^2$ Pa s at eruption  temperature tend to form dyke $1$ m
wide, while felsic  magmas, with viscosities of $10^6$-$10^7$  Pa s at
eruption temperature, tend  to form dykes $100$ m wide.   For the same
overpressure   gradient,  plugin   in   these   parameters  in   $Q_0$
(\ref{C2-eq11}) gives an injection rate  close to $0.1$ m$^3$ s$^{-1}$
for mafic  lavas and $2.5~10^3$  m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for felsic  lavas. The
height scale $H$ is thus $\sim 25$ for felsic laccolith and $\sim 0.1$
m for large mafic sills.

The model  also considers  a thin pre-wetted  film of  thickness $h_f$
whose  meaning in  the application  to the  spreading of  laccolith is
unclear.  In  particular, the  model shows  no convergence  when $h_f$
tends to zero \citep{Lister:2013ia} and therefore, the thickness $h_f$
might be  linked to some structural  length scale at the  front of the
laccolith or  to the natural  imperfection of the flow  geometry.  For
the purpose of the application, we  choose a film thickness of $1$ mm,
i.e.  the  minimum length  scale with  physical signification  for the
spreading of laccoliths  which give a dimensionless  $h_f$ that varies
between $10^{-2}$  and $10^{-4}$.  In  the following, we set  $h_f$ to
$10^{-3}$.

\vspace{.5cm}  \textbf{Dimensionless  data  and  comparison  with  the
  model} \vspace{.5cm}

Each  magmatic   intrusion  unit  is  made   dimensionless  using  its
characteristic  length   scale  $\Lambda$,  which  depends   upon  the
intrusion depth, and its characteristic  height scale, which is either
$H=25$  m for  felsic laccolith  or $H=0.1$  m for  large mafic  sills
(Figure  \ref{Corry_Rocchie}).   First,  the dimensionless  radius  of
laccoliths at  Elba Island and  $95\%$ of those  from \citet{E:2015tl}
are  smaller than  $4$ consistent  with  their arrest  in the  bending
regime. The prediction of the model for the evolution of the thickness
$h_0$ of  the current as  a function of its  radius $R$ can  be easily
derived from  the scaling  laws (\ref{ScalingH})  and (\ref{ScalingR})
and should follow
\begin{equation}
  h_0 \sim 0.3h_f^{-1/7} R^{8/7}\label{C2-Hr}
\end{equation}
in agreement  with the  power law relationship  $h_0 =  bR^a$ proposed
initially         by         \citet{McCaffrey:1997ea}         (Section
\ref{sec:empl-dynam-des}).   To characterize  the mean  trend in  each
population, we make use of a linear least-square regression in log-log
space to obtain a value for the  coefficient $a$ and $b$ that best fit
the observation.  We  found $h_0 = 21 R^{1.22}$ for  the laccoliths at
Elba island which  is very close to $R^{1.14}$ predicted  by the model
(Figure  \ref{Corry_Rocchie}).    Actually,  the  geometry   of  these
laccoliths is not well known  and probably not perfectly axisymmetric.
\citet{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}  found that  for  a  two dimensional  flow,
$h_0\propto \delta^{1/7}L^{1.42}$ where $L$  is the half-length of the
flow.  The best fit value for  the coefficient $a$ then nicely inserts
between  the  expected values  for  the  two  geometries as  noted  by
\citet{Michaut:2011kg}.    In  contrast,   the   prediction  for   the
coefficient $b$  is much smaller  than the predicted value.   Even for
$h_f=10^{-2}$, which would  be an upper bound for  this parameter, the
model predict  $b=0.15$, which is  three orders of  magnitudes smaller
than the observation (Figure  \ref{Corry_Rocchie}).  Matching the data
to the  model will require  using a  viscosity $\eta_h$ for  the magma
abnormally  high, i.e.   $\eta_h \sim  10^{12}$ Pa  s or  unreasonable
injection rate, i.e. $Q_0\sim 1$ km$^3$ s$^{-1}$.

The  best  fit   power  law  relationship  for   the  laccoliths  from
\citet{E:2015tl} is  $h_0 = 21 R^{0.62}$  (Figure \ref{Corry_Rocchie},
$r^2 =0.54$). In  that case, the exponent $a$ is  smaller than one and
does not agree  with the model.  This value for  $a$, slightly smaller
than    the   value    calculated    directly   on    the   data    by
\citet{McCaffrey:1997ea}, was interpreted as  reflecting the two stage
growth  process historically  invoked for  the formation  of laccolith
(Section  \ref{sec:empl-dynam-des}). However,  the  dispersion in  the
data   is    much   important    than   in   the    observation   from
\citet{Rocchi:2010dn}   and   not   taken    into   account   in   the
nondimensionalization which  assumes the  same parameters for  all the
different laccoliths.

Half of the  large mafic sills show dimensionless  radius smaller than
$R=4$, not consistent with their  arrest in the gravity current regime
(Figure \ref{Corry_Rocchie}).  It might suggest that these mafic sills
have intruded shallower into the crust; for instance, for $d_c=250$ m,
the  characteristic  length  scale  for  the  mafic  sill  is  smaller
$\Lambda=800$ m and $95\%$ of the population show dimensionless radius
larger than  $4$. Nevertheless,  their dimensionless  thickness, which
should tend to  a constant of order $O(1)$ according  to the model, is
much larger than the expected value and increases with the radius $R$.
For a gravity current in a  two dimensional geometry, the thickness is
indeed  expected to  increase  with the  length of  the  sill, but  as
$L^{1/4}$ \citet{Michaut:2011kg}  which is much weaker  than the found
value for the  coefficient $a$ of $0.76$ for large  mafic sill (Figure
\ref{Corry_Rocchie}).   Therefore,   the  model   prediction   toughly
reconcile with the observation for large mafic sills.

\subsection{Origin of lunar low-slope domes}
\label{sec:observ-vs-pred}

\vspace{.5cm}\hspace{.5cm} \textbf{Dataset} \vspace{.5cm}

On the  Moon, $13$ elongated  low-slope domes have been  identified as
potentially      intrusive     domes      instead     of      effusive
\citep{Wohler:2007it,Wohler:2009jj}.   \citet{Wohler:2009jj}  used  an
image-based $3D$ reconstruction approach which relies on a combination
of photoclinometry and shape from  shading techniques to determine the
morphometric  properties of  each of  these lunar  domes. This  method
results in a $10\%$ error estimation on the intrusion thickness.




\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Range of value for the parameters} \vspace{.5cm}

Given the basalt composition of most lunar rocks from the mare brought
back from  Appolo missions,  the lunar  magmas are  more likely  to be
mafic in  composition and we use  $\rho_m = 2900$ kg  m$^{-3}$ for the
lava density. Therefore, on the Moon,  the larger lava density and the
smaller  gravity  leads  to  length  scale  $1.5$  times  larger  than
terrestrial ones; for  instance, using $E=10$ GPa and $d_c  = 1.5$ km,
the characteristic  length scale for  lunar intrusions is $\sim  5$ km
and $3.3$ km for a terrestrial laccolith.

The source of  magma in the lunar interior are  poorly constrained and
more likely to  be deeper than on  Earth; most of the  mare basalt are
thought to be a product of melting initiated deep in the lunar mantle,
deeper than $400$ km \citep{Shearer:2006gg}.  Using the same value for
the initial driving pressure, $\Delta P = 50$ MPa, unless lunar magmas
are  likely to  be  more  mafic and  contain  less volatiles  implying
smaller driving pressure, and a depth of $500$ km for the magma source
region, the overpressure  gradient is only of $100$  Pa m$^{-1}$. Mare
basalt, which  have lower  concentration in alkalies  than terrestrial
basalt, should also  have a lower viscosity.  We take  $\eta_h=1$ Pa s
and  for a  dyke  $10$ m  thick, the  injection  rate is  $Q_0=10^{4}$
m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$ and the typical height scale $H\sim 2$ m .

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Predictions versus observations} \vspace{.5cm}

After   nondimensionalization,   the   lunar  low-slope   domes   show
dimensionless radius smaller than $4$  consistent with their arrest in
the bending  regime. In  addition, they  are almost  perfectly aligned
with   the   terrestrial   laccolith    from   Elba   Island   (Figure
\ref{Corry_Rocchie}) \citep{Michaut:2011kg}. Indeed,  the best fit for
all  the  observations,  lunar  domes +  Elba  island  laccoliths,  is
$h_0   =    10R^{1.11}$   with   a   high    correlation   coefficient
$r^2=0.94$. Given that  the same intrusion depth  has been arbitrarily
chosen  for   all  intrusions,  the  fit   is  surprisingly  accurate.
Therefore, the isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current model is able
to explain the difference between  Earth laccolith and lunar intrusive
domes \citep{Michaut:2011kg}.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion-1}

Historical models  for intermediate scale magmatic  intrusion consider
that  the main  phase  of  laccolith growth  and  spreading require  a
two-stage process: horizontal spreading of a sill followed by vertical
inflation  when the  sill has  grown horizontally  enough so  that the
magma has  enough leverage on  the overlying  layers to begin  to bend
them  upward  \citep{Johnson:1973ho,Koch:1981if}.  More  recent  model
proposed  instead   that  these  intrusions   form  as  a   series  of
sub-horizontally            staked             magma            sheets
\citep{Morgan:2008hj,Menand:2011ki}.   While both  model  are able  to
account for several geological observations, they both lack a physical
description of the intrusion process and  are then not able to explain
the solidified morphology of these  magmatic intrusions in term of the
flow parameters (injection rate, volume) at the time of emplacement.

\vspace{.5cm}   \textbf{Isoviscous  elastic-plated   gravity  current}
\vspace{.5cm}

\citet{Michaut:2011kg}  has   developed  a   new  approach   to  model
intermediate-scale intrusion such as  sill, laccolith or bysmalith. In
particular,  \citet{Michaut:2011kg} develop  a dynamic  elastic-plated
gravity  current model  that consider  both  the bending  and the  own
weight of the  magma as driving the flow.  This  model shows promising
result  in  predicting the  variety  of  shape of  intermediate  scale
magmatic intrusions; from the dome shape of laccolith to the disk-like
morphology of  large mafic  sill.  It allows  to relate  the laccolith
morphology  to the  crustal and  magma physical  properties, and  more
importantly,  to the  injection rate.   The prediction  of the  model,
especially  the scaling  law for  the thickness  versus length  in the
bending regime,  also fits the  variability in the laccolith  units at
Elba  Island,  hence providing  for  a  physical explanation  for  the
observed relationship between laccolith length and thickness. Finally,
the model show promising result  in explaining the discrepancy between
terrestrial  laccolith  and low-slope  lunar  domes  on the  Moon  and
therefore  can be  use to  assess  the intrusive  origin of  intrusive
candidates on other planets.

However, there  are questions that  remain open. First, we  have shown
that the  model hardly account for  the absolute final value  for both
the   thickness  and   the  radius   of  these   laccolith  and   that
reconciliating predictions  and observations requires  abnormally high
magma viscosity.  Second,  the model was also not able  to account for
the increase in  large mafic sill thickness with  their diameter. More
importantly, the  model crucially  lack of  a stopping  criterion that
could predict the  final morphology of a magmatic  intrusion given its
input parameters. Fracturation is generally considered as the limiting
mechanism to the expansion of magmatic intrusion.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Criterion for fracturation} \vspace{.5cm}

As the flow length increases, the pressure in the intrusion eventually
decreases to  the critical value  equal to the pressure  necessary for
fracturing the  tip. In that case,  fracturing at the tip  might limit
spreading and trigger the arrest of a laccolith in the bending regime.
The  stress intensity  factor  $K_I$ for  a mode  $I$  fracture and  a
uniformly loaded crack situated close to a boundary (i.e., $d<<R$) can
be approximated by \citep{Dyskin:2000iz,Bunger:2005ee}
\begin{equation}
  K_I = K_M M_0 d_c^{-3/2}
  \label{KC}
\end{equation}
where $K_M = 1.932$  is a constant and $M_0$ is  the bending moment at
the crack tip given by
\begin{equation}
  M_0        =        -D       \left.\left(\frac{\partial^2        h}{\partial
        r^2}+\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial                     h}{\partial
        r}\right)\right|_{r=R(t)}.
  \label{moment}
\end{equation}
Once  $K_I$   reaches  the   fracture  toughness  limit   $K_c$,  i.e.
$\sim 4-400$ MPa m$^{1/2}$ \citep{Olson:2003hc}, fracturing at the tip
will limits the intrusion lateral extent.

Injecting the  scaling for the  thickness $h_0$  as a function  of the
radius $R$ (\ref{C2-Hr}) with dimension  into the predicted flow shape
in the bending regime(\ref{IntrusionShape}) gives  the flow shape as a
function of the radius $R(t)$ of the laccolith
\begin{equation}
  h(r,t) = 20 H \Lambda^{-8/7} R(t)^{8/7}\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2(t)}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
Injecting  this  expression  into (\ref{moment})  and  (\ref{KC})  and
inverting  for  the radius,  one  can  then  found that  the  critical
dimensionless radius $R_{cr}$ for the laccolith is
\begin{equation}
  R_{cr} \sim \frac{20 E^{7/6} H^{7/6} K_{m}^{7/6}}{K_{c}^{7/6} \Lambda^{7/3}} d^{7/4}
\end{equation}
which, in terms of the parameters, it reads
\begin{equation}
  R_{cr} \sim 142 E^{7/12}K_{m}^{7/6} Q_{0}^{7/24} \eta_h^{7/24} g^{7/24} \rho_m^{7/24}}K_{c}^{-7/6}
\end{equation}
and therefore depends mainly in the fracture toughness of the encasing
rocks.  On can calculate that for typical crustal and magma parameters
taken   in   Section  \ref{C2-sec:appl-earth-moon}   for   terrestrial
laccoliths and the largest reported value for the parameter $K_c=4000$
MPa m$^{1/2}$, the critical dimensionless radius is equal to $\sim 10$
and therefore,  still much larger  than the transition  radius between
the bending and gravity regime  $R= 4$.  Therefore, while fracturation
might explain the  arrest of magmatic intrusion for  large mafic sill,
it  does  not  provide  a  sufficient  mechanism  for  the  arrest  of
laccolith.

\section{Toward a more realistic model for shallow magmatic intrusions}
\label{C2-sec:discussion}

We have shown that while it shows promising results in reproducing the
morphology of  solidified magmatic intrusions  on Earth and  the Moon,
the isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current suffers some limitations
as  well.  In  this manuscript,  we propose  to explore  two important
mechanisms  that have  been  neglected until  now  and will  certainly
influence the emplacement of shallow  magmatic intrusions in the crust
of terrestrial  planets: the  effect a  temperature-dependent rheology
for  the magma  and the  effect of  an overburden  characterized by  a
non-constant thickness.

The former has already shown important implications for the cooling of
lava                                                             domes
\citep{Bercovici:2007vc,Bercovici:1996uu,BALMFORTH:1999ey,Garel:2014era}. Indeed,
the viscosity of magma can vary by several orders of magnitudes during
the  cooling \citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Lejeune:1995fc}  and therefore,
as the fluid cools, its  composition and crystal content change which,
in  turn,  modifies  the  viscosity  and  the  dynamics  of  the  flow
itself. The  first part of the  manuscript deals with this  matter and
try  to better  understand the  dynamics of  a cooling  elastic-plated
gravity current.  In particular, in chapter  $3$, we derive a model of
a cooling  elastic-plated gravity  current with a  viscosity inversely
dependent  on temperature  and isothermal  boundary conditions.   This
model  is next  further refined  and  compared to  the observation  in
chapter $4$.

The second  part of the manuscript  addresses the second point  and in
particular, the problem of crater-centered intrusions with application
to the endogenous deformation observed at lunar floor-fractured craters.
Indeed, if large volume of  magma have effectively intruded at shallow
depth below  these craters as proposed  by \citet{Schultz:1976kt}, the
topography  of  the  initial  impact   crater  has  to  constrain  the
underlying magma spreading dynamics. Chapter  $5$ presents a model for
crater-centered  intrusions and  its application  to the  deformations
observed at  floor-fractured craters.  Finally, chapter  $6$ takes the
study of  floor-fractured craters one  step further by looking  at the
gravitational signature of lunar  floor-fractured craters in the light
of the model predictions.

This  approach, evolving  each time  from a  theoretical model  to the
observations, might  help shed  light both on  the limitations  of the
model of \citet{Michaut:2011kg} exposed in this chapter and the origin
of lunar-floor fractured craters.

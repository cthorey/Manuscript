\chapter[Isoviscous elastic-plated  gravity current]{Isoviscous elastic-plated  gravity current model  for shallow
  magmatic intrusions}

\label{chap2} 
\minitoc

\citet{Michaut:2011kg} proposed a model for the spreading of a shallow
depth  intermediate-size intrusion,  in  which  magma is  continuously
injected  at the  center and  is accommodated  by the  bending of  the
overlying strata.  In particular, the model differs from previous ones
by considering both the dynamics of the emplacement itself, in a sense
that the radius is self-consistently determined, and the driving force
associated with  the magma  weight.  Both  were neglected  in previous
models.  In the original  paper from \citet{Michaut:2011kg}, the model
was  derived  in both  Cartesian  and  axisymmetric geometry  and  the
results  were presented  in $2D$.   A similar  model in  $2D$ with  an
additional fracture  criterion at  the tip of  the intrusion  has been
derived   by   \citet{Bunger:2011cb}  and   \citet{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}
discussed more precisely the dynamics at the contact line and the case
of an elastic-plated gravity current spreading over an inclined plane.
In this chapter, we present a summary of the model and the results for
the spreading of  an isoviscous elastic-plated gravity  current over a
rigid horizontal  surface in  an axisymmetrical geometry.   Results in
this geometry  have been  thoroughly studied  by \citet{Lister:2013ia}
and this  will constitute the  reference for more elaborate  models in
the manuscript.

\section{Theoretical model}
\label{C2-sec:model}

The model considers an isoviscous elastic-plated gravity current, i.e.
an  isoviscous  fluid  of  viscosity  $\eta_h$  and  density  $\rho_m$
spreading beneath a thin elastic sheet  of thickness $d_0$ and above a
semi infinite rigid layer \citep{Michaut:2011kg,Bunger:2011cb} (Figure
\ref{C2-Sketch}).  The fluid is injected  continuously at the base and
center of the current at a rate $Q_0$ through a cylindrical conduit of
diameter $a$.

\subsection{Governing equations}
\label{C2-sec:Governing equation}

\textbf{Driving pressure}\\

The  intrusion develops  over a  length scale  $\Lambda$ that  is much
larger than its thickness $H$ ($\epsilon = H/ \Lambda \ll 1$).  In the
laminar  regime  and  in  axisymmetrical  coordinates  ($r$,$z$),  the
Navier-Stokes equations within the lubrication assumption are
\begin{eqnarray}
  -\frac{\partial P}{\partial r}  +  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\eta_h \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right) &=&0,\label{C2_V1} \\
  -\frac{\partial P}{\partial z}  - \rho_{m}g&  =&0,\label{C2-Npressure}
\end{eqnarray}
where  $u(r,z,t)$  is  the  radial   velocity,  $g$  is  the  standard
acceleration due to gravity and  $P(r,z,t)$ is the pressure within the
fluid.   Integration  of  (\ref{C2-Npressure}) thus  gives  the  total
pressure  $P(r,z,t)$ within  the flow.   When the  vertical deflection
$h(r,t)$ of the upper elastic layer is small compared to its thickness
$d_0$, i.e $h \ll d_0$, we can neglect stretching of the upper layer and
only  consider  bending  stresses.    Therefore,  the  total  pressure
$P(r,z,t)$  at  a level  $z$  in  the intrusion  is  the  sum of  four
contributions: the  weight of the  magma and  of the upper  layer, the
bending pressure $P_e$ and the atmospheric pressure $P_0$
\begin{equation}
  P = \rho_m g (h-z)+\rho_rg d_0+P_e+P_0,
  \label{C2-pression}
\end{equation}
where $h(r,t)$ is the intrusion  thickness and $\rho_r$ the density of
the surrounding rocks. The bending pressure  is given by the force per
unit area  that is necessary  for a  vertical displacement $h$  of the
thin elastic plate \citep{Turcotte:1982ca}
\begin{equation}
  P_e = D_e\nabla_r^4h,
\end{equation}
where $D_e$  is the flexural  rigidity of  the thin elastic  layer, that
depends on the Young's modulus $E$, Poisson's ratio $\nu^*$ and on the
elastic           layer          thickness           $d_0$          as
$D_e = Ed_0^3/\left(12(1-\nu^*^2)\right)$.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Velocity field} \vspace{.5cm}

At the contact with the elastic sheet $z=h(r,t)$, the no-slip boundary
condition  hold;  the  tangential  velocity is  zero  and  the  normal
velocity  is the  rate of  height change  ($\partial h/  \partial t$).
With $\vec{n}$ the normal to the surface and $\vec{t}$ the tangent, we
have
\begin{eqnarray}
  \vec{n} \cdot \vec{u} &=& \frac{\partial h }{\partial t},\\
  \vec{t} \cdot \vec{u} &=& 0. \label{C2-tangeant}
\end{eqnarray}
The  tangent  vector is  $\vec{t}  =  (1,  \partial h/  \partial  r)$.
However, within the lubrication  assumption, the vertical component of
the  tangent  vector scales  as  $\epsilon$  and thus,  is  negligible
compared to  the radial  component. Therefore, the  boundary condition
(\ref{C2-tangeant}) reduces  to $u(r,z=h,t) =0$.   At the base  of the
flow, the same boundary condition holds and $u(r,z=0,t) =0$.

Equation (\ref{C2_V1}) is integrated twice  as a function of $z$ using
these boundary conditions and the horizontal velocity is
\begin{equation}
  u(r,z,t) =\frac{1}{2\eta_h} \frac{\partial P}{\partial r} \left(z^2-hz\right).
  \label{C2-vel}
\end{equation}

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Injection rate} \vspace{.5cm}

Assuming a Poiseuille flow within the cylindrical feeding conduit, the
vertical  injection velocity  $w_i(r,t)$ and  constant injection  rate
$Q_0$ are given by
\begin{equation}
  w_i(r,t)=
  \begin{cases}
    \frac{ \Delta P}{4 \eta_h Z_{c}} (\frac{a^{2}}{4}-r^{2})& r \le \frac{a}{2}\\
    0 & r > \frac{a}{2}
  \end{cases},
  \label{C2-eq12}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  Q_{0}=\frac{\pi \Delta P a^{4}}{128 \eta_h Z_c},
  \label{C2-eq11}
\end{equation}
where  $\Delta P$  is  the  initial overpressure  within  the melt  at
$z=Z_{c}$.

\vspace{.5cm} \textbf{Mass conservation} \vspace{.5cm}

The fluid  is assumed  incompressible and a  global statement  of mass
conservation gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial         h}{\partial        t} +\frac{1}{r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial
  r} \left( r\int_0^hudz\right) = w_i.
  \label{C2-Mass}
\end{eqnarray}
Injecting  (\ref{C2-vel})  into  (\ref{C2-Mass}),  we  find  that  the
equation for the evolution of the thickness in time and space reads
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t} =\frac{\rho_mg}{12 \eta_h r}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial r}  \left( rh^3  \frac{\partial h}{\partial
      r}\right)+\frac{D_e}{12\eta_h r} \left( rh^3 \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\nabla_r^4h\right)+
  w_i .\label{C2-Heq}
\end{equation}
It is  composed of three different  terms on the right  hand side. The
first term represents gravitational  spreading, i.e.  spreading of the
current under its own weight. The second term represents the squeezing
of the flow by the bending of the upper elastic layer.  Both term are negative and
induces spreading.   The last term  represents fluid injection  and is
positive.

\subsection{Dimensionless equations}
\label{C2-sec:dimens-equat}

Equation (\ref{C2-Heq}) is nondimensionalized using a horizontal scale
$\Lambda$, a vertical scale $H$ and a time scale $\tau$ given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  \Lambda &=& \left(\frac{D_p}{\rho_m g}\right)^{1/4},\label{C2-L1}\\
  H&=&\left       (\frac{12\eta_h      Q_{0}}{\rho_{m}g       \pi}\right      )
       ^{\frac{1}{4}} ,\label{C2-H1}\\
  \tau&=&\frac{\pi \Lambda^{2} H}{Q_{0}},\label{C2-T1}
\end{eqnarray}
in which scales are chosen such  that $Q_0 = \pi\Lambda^2 H/\tau$. The
length scale $\Lambda$ represents the flexural wavelength of the upper
elastic layer,  i.e. the  length scale at  which bending  stresses and
gravity  equally contribute  to flow.   The  height scale  $H$ is  the
thickness of  a typical gravity current  and the time scale  $\tau$ is
the  characteristic time  to  fill  up a  cylindrical  flow of  radius
$\Lambda$ and thickness  $H$ at constant rate $Q_0$.   In addition, we
can       define        a       horizontal        velocity       scale
$U=\Lambda/\tau=\left(\rho_m           g           H^3\right)/\left(12
  \eta_h\Lambda\right)$ and a pressure scale $\rho_m g H$.

The dimensionless equation is
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}& =&\frac{1}{ r}
                                    \frac{\partial}{\partial r}  \left( rh^3  \frac{\partial h}{\partial
                                    r}\right)+\frac{1}{ r} \left( rh^3
                                    \frac{\partial}{\partial
                                    r}\nabla_r^4h\right)\nonumber\\
                               &+&
                                   \mathcal{H}(\frac{\gamma}{2}-r)\frac{32}{\gamma^{2}}\left(\frac{1}{4}-\frac{r^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}\right),
                                   \label{C2-mainEq}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\mathcal{H}$ is the  Heaviside function and $\gamma=a/\Lambda$.
The dimensionless number  $\gamma$ is the dimensionless  radius of the
conduit and  does not significantly influence  the flow; it is  set to
$0.02$ in the following \citep{Michaut:2009jx,Michaut:2011kg}.
	 
\subsection{Need for regularization}
\label{C2-sec:need-regularization}

One  of   the  main   mathematical  difficulty  in   solving  equation
(\ref{C2-mainEq}) arises at the contact line between the rigid support
and the elastic  plate.  Indeed, the assumption that  the thickness of
the fluid tends to zero at the contact line leads to divergent viscous
stresses, i.e.   $\eta_h \partial u/\partial z\rightarrow  \infty$ and
hence,     the    theoretical     immobility     of    the     blister
\citep{Flitton:1999iv,Lister:2013ia,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}. This problem,
known  as  the  contact-line  paradox,  is a  well  know  problem  for
surface-tension driven flow  such as the spreading of  a water droplet
\citep{Bertozzi:1998wz,Snoeijer:2013cm}.

The formal proof  has been given by \citet{Flitton:1999iv}  and can be
derived as follows.  Suppose that  (\ref{C2-mainEq}) has a solution and
the solution near the contact line has the form
\begin{equation}
  h(r,t) \sim A(t)(R(t)-r)^{\alpha}.
  \label{eqFormH}
\end{equation}
As $r \rightarrow R(t)$, the  bending term dominates the gravitational
term and (\ref{C2-mainEq}) reduces to
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial       h}{\partial       t}&      =&\frac{1}{       r}
                                                     \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left( rh^3 \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\nabla_r^4h\right).
                                                     \label{C2-mainEq2}
\end{eqnarray}
Injecting (\ref{eqFormH}) into (\ref{C2-mainEq2}) and keeping only the
leading powers of $R-r$ gives
\begin{eqnarray}
  \frac{\partial    R}{\partial    t}    A\alpha\left(R-r\right)^{\alpha-1}+
  \frac{\partial           A}{\partial           t}\left(R-r)^{\alpha}
  &=&A^4\alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)\nonumber\\
  &&(\alpha-3)(\alpha-4)(\alpha-5)(R-r)^{4\alpha-6}.\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The time derivative is locally dominated by its convective part at the
tip, the second  term on the left  is small compared to  the first and
therefore, by equating the exponent of $R-r$, we obtain $\alpha = 5/3$
and then
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial R}{\partial r} =-\frac{280}{243} A^3.
\end{equation}
Given  that $A>0$,  this shows  that (\ref{C2-mainEq})  can only  have
solutions  with  retreating  contact  line ($dR/dt<0$)  but  not  with
advancing             contact             line             ($dR/dt>0$)
\citep{Lister:2013ia,Flitton:1999iv}.

To  mitigate this  problem,  one  common approach  is  to  add a  thin
prewetting film, with thickness $h_f$  such that $h\rightarrow h_f$ as
$r\rightarrow  \infty$ (Figure  \ref{C2-Sketch}).  While  the solution
will depend upon the prewetting film thickness $h_f$ and will not show
any convergence properties  when $h_f\rightarrow 0$, we  will see that
the dependence in  $h_f$ is weak and the  difference between different
values      for      $h_f$      will     be      relatively      small
\citep{Lister:2013ia,Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}.  Unless otherwise specified,
we will often consider $h_f =  5\cdot 10^{-3}$ in the manuscript which
represents the  smallest length  scale with physical  meaning (Section
\ref{sec:range-valu-param}).



\section{Results}
\label{C2-sec:regime-propagations}

For a small prewetting film thickness, i.e.  $h_f \ll 1$, the numerical
resolution  of the  equation  (\ref{C2-mainEq})  shows two  asymptotic
spreading regimes: a bending regime  where gravity is negligible and a
viscous   gravity  current   regime   where   bending  is   negligible
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Bunger:2011cb,Lister:2013ia}. In  the following,
we present the shape of the flow  as well as scaling laws that predict
the evolution of  the thickness at the center $h_0(t)$  and the radius
$R(t)$ in each regime.

      the characteristic  scales (thickness,  length or time  given by
      (\ref{C2-H1}),   (\ref{C2-L1})  or   (\ref{C2-T1}))  to   obtain
      dimensional values.  For $t<10$, the intrusion is in the bending
      regime  whereas  for $t>10$  the  intrusion  is in  the  gravity
      current regime.}
    \label{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Profil}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Bending regime}
\label{C2-sec:bending-regime}

At early times, when $R \ll \Lambda$, gravity is negligible and the
dynamics of  the spreading  is governed  by the  bending of  the upper
layer.

In that case, the spreading is  very slow and the interior has uniform
dimensionless pressure $P =\nabla_r^4h$.   The flow is bell-shaped and
its thickness is given by
\begin{equation}
  h(r,t) = h_0(t)\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2(t)}\right)^2,
  \label{C2-IntrusionShape}
\end{equation}
with $h_0(t)$  the thickness  of the intrusion  at the  center (Figure
\ref{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Profil},                                     $t<10$)
\citep{Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia}.       In       this      regime,
\citet{Lister:2013ia} have  shown that the spreading  is controlled by
the propagation  of a peeling by  bending wave at the  intrusion front
with dimensionless velocity $c$
\begin{equation}
  c=    \frac{\partial             R}{\partial            t}             =h_f^{1/2}
  \left(\frac{\kappa}{1.35}\right)^{5/2},
  \label{C2-WaveVelocity}
\end{equation}
where  $\kappa  =  \partial^2  h/\partial r^2$  is  the  dimensionless
curvature  of  the  interior  solution.   Using  the  propagation  law
(\ref{C2-WaveVelocity})  and   the  form  of  the   interior  solution
(\ref{C2-IntrusionShape}), they find that the radius and the height of
the intrusion evolve following
\begin{eqnarray}
  R(t) &=& 2.2h_f^{1/22}t^{7/22},\label{C2-ScalingR}\\
  h_0(t)&=&0.7 h_f^{-1/11}t^{8/22},\label{C2-ScalingH}
\end{eqnarray}
where the  numerical prefactors match  our simulations as well  as the
results  of  \citet{Lister:2013ia}  (Figure  \ref{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Sigma})
. The bell-shaped morphology of the  flow in this regime is very close
to  the  dome-shaped  morphology   of  solidified  laccoliths  (Figure
\ref{C1-picture} c, d, e) \citep{Michaut:2011kg}.

      gravity regime $R(t) = 1.2t^{1/2}$.}
    \label{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Sigma}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gravity current regime}
\label{C2-sec:grav-curr-regime}

In contrast,  when the radius  R becomes larger than  $\sim 4\Lambda$,
the weight of  the intrusion becomes dominant over  the bending terms.
The  dimensionless  pressure  is  given by  the  hydrostatic  pressure
$P = h$  and the intrusion enters a classical  viscous gravity current
regime where bending terms only affect the solution near the intrusion
edge         (Figure        \ref{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Profil},         $t>10$)
\citep{Huppert:1982a,Michaut:2011kg,Lister:2013ia}.   In  this  second
regime, while the thickness tends to be a constant, the radius evolves
as $t^{1/2}$ (Figure \ref{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Sigma}).  The flow is therefore
characterized by a small aspect-ratio $h_0/R$ and a constant thickness
disk-like  morphology close  to the  one  shown by  large mafic  sills
(Figure \ref{C1-picture} a).

In between the bending  and gravity regime, \citet{Lister:2013ia} also
describe  a short  intermediate regime  where the  peeling by  bending
continues to control the propagation  but where, due to the increasing
effect  of gravity,  the  flow shows  an  interior flat-topped  region
(Figure   \ref{C2_ELAS_GRAV_Profil},    $t=38$).    This   flat-topped
morphology     is     also     observed    for     many     laccoliths
\citep{Koch:1981if,Bunger:2011cb}.

Therefore, the  model is able  to reproduce  the variety of  shapes of
intermediate scale magmatic  intrusions: from the dome  shape and flat
topped morphology  of laccolith to  the disk-like morphology  of large
mafic sills.   In the following,  we quantitatively compare  the model
predictions to some observations on terrestrial planets.


\section{Application to the spreading of shallow magmatic intrusions}
\label{C2-sec:appl-earth-moon}

\subsection{Observations versus predictions on Earth}
\label{C2-sec:observ-vs-pred-Earth}

\subsubsection*{Observations}

\citet{E:2015tl}  has made  an extensive  catalog of  $900$ laccoliths
across  the  world.   In  particular,  \citet{E:2015tl}  provides  the
thickness and  the radius of $168$  laccoliths.  For $40$ of  them, he
gives an estimate for the  intrusion depth.  These laccoliths, who are
mainly felsic in  composition, show thicknesses that  range from $100$
meters  to $1$  km  with radii  in  between $1$  and  $10$ km  (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie} a).  While most of  the data are located in the
United State ($\sim 90\%$), the different laccoliths are widely spread
among  the territory  and variations  in the  flow parameters  between
different laccoliths are most likely to be important.
\begin{figure}[h!]

      the    Christmas   tree    structure    shortly   after    their
      formations. Figure modified from \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}.}
    \label{C2_Geological_Data}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

In addition  to the  data from \citet{E:2015tl},  we also  consider in
this  study   the  data  provided  by   \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}  on  $9$
laccoliths nested in a Christmas  tree structure at Elba Island, Italy
(Figure   \ref{C2_Geological_Data}).    The   detailed   mapping   and
reconstruction  of  tectonic  history  made  by  \citet{Rocchi:2002jy}
provides  the parameters  of  each intrusive  layer  in the  laccolith
complex. In  addition, for this dataset,  each laccolith is part  of a
larger intrusive system. Hence, except for the overlying elastic layer
thickness,  assumed to  be the  intrusion  depth in  the model,  whose
variation  between  laccoliths   is  given  by  \citet{Rocchi:2002jy},
variability of the model parameters should be limited.  The dispersion
is much  smaller for this dataset;  the radius ranges from  $800$ m to
$5$  km   and  the  thickness   from  $50$   m  to  $700$   m  (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie} a).

Finally, we also  show the morphology of $25$ large  mafic sills whose
thicknesses  and   radii  are   given  by   \citet{Cruden:tg}  (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}  a).  In  order  to account  for the  intrinsic
scale of different settings for each intrusion and compare them to the
model,   the  data   have   first  to   be  nondimensionalized   using
characteristic  values for  each intrusion  parameters and  also their
depth, when absent from the catalog.

\subsubsection*{Range of values for the parameters}
\label{sec:range-valu-param}

In terrestrial settings, magma density  $\rho_m$ mainly depends on its
composition and varies  between $ 2500$ kg m$^{-3}$  for felsic magmas
to  $2900$ kg  m$^{-3}$  for more  mafic  magmas.  Reported  intrusion
depths vary from $180$ to  $2200$ m for laccoliths in \citet{E:2015tl}
and from $1.9$ to $3.7$ km  for laccoliths at Elba Island.  Hence, for
a Young's modulus  value of $10$ GPa, the  characteristic length scale
$\Lambda$ varies between  $\sim 1$ km and $\sim 7$  km for laccoliths.
The  density does  not  affect much  the value  of  $\Lambda$ and  the
characteristic length  scale for large  mafic sills, whose  depths are
not reported  in \citet{Cruden:tg} and  set to  $1.5$ km, is  equal to
$\sim 3$ km.

On Earth, laccoliths are generally  formed by relatively evolved lavas
that  may have  differentiated from  primitive magma  in deep  crustal
magma chambers,  located some $5$  to $15$  km below the  surface. The
overpressures  driving magma  ascent are  typically $20$  to $50$  MPa
\citep{Stasiuk:1993kg,Barmin:2002ea},    which   gives    overpressure
gradients  of $\sim  10^3$ Pa  m$^{-1}$.  Lava  viscosity at  eruption
temperature  $\eta_h$  mainly depends  on  its  composition and  water
content; close to its liquidus temperature, it can vary from $10^2$ Pa
s   for   mafic   lavas   to   $10^{6}$  Pa   s   for   felsic   lavas
\citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Giordano:2008em,Whittington:2009fv,Chevrel:2013jn}. However,
\citet{Wada:2007tv} shows that  the dyke width tends  to increase with
viscosity  to the  power  $1/4$ \citep{Kerr:1995tl}  and overall,  the
injection   rate  $Q_0$   should  be   similar  for   different  magma
compositions.  Based on common effusion  rate for lava flows on Earth,
we       take       $Q_0\sim       0.1-100$       m$^3$       s$^{-1}$
\citep{Pieri:1986bf,Harris:2000jd,Castro:2013jo,Tuffen:2013di}.    The
height  scale $H$  thus varies  between  $ 1$  and $10$  m for  felsic
laccoliths and between $0.1$ and $1$ m for large mafic sills.

The model  also considers  a thin prewetting  film of  thickness $h_f$
whose meaning  in the  application to the  spreading of  laccoliths is
unclear.  In  particular, the  model shows  no convergence  when $h_f$
tends to zero \citep{Lister:2013ia}.  Hence, the thickness $h_f$ might
be  linked  to some  structural  length  scale  at  the front  of  the
laccolith or  to the natural  imperfection of the flow  geometry.  For
millimeter to  centimeter scale  film, the dimensionless  $h_f$ varies
between $10^{-4}$ and  $10^{-2}$. For the purpose  of the application,
we   choose  the   same   value  than   for   the  simulations,   i.e.
$h_f=5\times  10^{-3}$. Further  details  on the  effect  of $h_f$  is
described in Appendix \ref{chap:A3}.

\subsubsection*{Dimensionless data and comparison with the model}


Each  magmatic   intrusion  unit  is  made   dimensionless  using  its
characteristic  length   scale  $\Lambda$,  which  depends on  the
intrusion depth, and  its characteristic height scale,  which is taken
as either $H=6$  m for felsic laccoliths or $H=0.6$  m for large mafic
sills (Figure \ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}). When the intrusion depth is not
provided, we  use $d_0=1.5$  km.  First,  the dimensionless  radius of
laccoliths at Elba Island and  most of those from \citet{E:2015tl} are
smaller than $4$  consistent with their arrest in  the bending regime.
The prediction of  the model for the evolution of  the thickness $h_0$
of the current as  a function of its radius $R$  can be easily derived
from the scaling laws  (\ref{C2-ScalingH}) and (\ref{C2-ScalingR}) and
should follow
\begin{equation}
  h_0 \sim 0.3h_f^{-1/7} R^{8/7}\label{C2-Hr},
\end{equation}
which  is consistent  with the  power  law relationship  $h_0 =  bR^a$
initially     proposed     by    \citet{McCaffrey:1997ea}     (Section
\ref{C1-sec:empl-dynam-des}). To  characterize the mean trend  in each
population, we use  a linear least-square regression  in log-log space
to obtain a  value for the coefficient  $a$ and $b$ that  best fit the
observations.  

We found $h_0  = 86 R^{1.22}$ for the laccoliths  at Elba island which
is  very   close  to  $R^{1.14}$   predicted  by  the   model  (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}, $r^2=0.96$).  Actually,  the geometry of these
laccoliths   is   not   well   known  and   probably   not   perfectly
axisymmetrical.   \citet{Anonymous:QWXp_4JV}  found  that  for  a  two
dimensional  flow, $h_0\propto  h_f^{-1/7}L^{10/7}$ where  $L$ is  the
half-length of the flow ($10/7\sim 1.43$).  The best fit value for the
coefficient $a$  then nicely inserts  between the expected  values for
the two  geometries as noted by  \citet{Michaut:2011kg}.  In contrast,
the prediction for the coefficient $b$  is much smaller than the value
derived from the observations.  Even for $h_f=10^{-2}$, which would be
an upper bound for this parameter, the model predict $b=0.6$, which is
three  orders  of magnitudes  smaller  than  the observations  (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}).  Matching the data  to the model will require
using  a  viscosity  $\eta_h$  for the  magma  abnormally  high,  i.e.
$\eta_h   \sim  10^{15}$   Pa  s   or  unreasonable   injection  rate,
i.e. $Q_0\sim 1$ km$^3$ s$^{-1}$.

The  best  fit   power  law  relationship  for   the  laccoliths  from
\citet{E:2015tl} is  $h_0 = 69  R^{0.46}$ ($r^2 =0.2$). In  that case,
the  exponent $a$  is smaller  than one  and does  not agree  with the
model.  This value for $a$, slightly smaller than the value calculated
directly on  the data by \citet{McCaffrey:1997ea},  was interpreted as
reflecting the  two-stage growth process historically  invoked for the
formation   of   laccoliths   (Section   \ref{C1-sec:empl-dynam-des}).
However, the dispersion is much more  important in this dataset and is
not taken into account in  the nondimensionalization which assumes the
same parameters for all the different laccoliths.  The model is indeed
able  to bracket  the observations  for $b$  varying between  $10$ and
$800$.   While this  range  of values  is also  much  larger than  the
predicted  value,  the  variations  in  the  parameters  at  different
intrusion sites might thus be  able to explain the discrepancy between
the model prediction and the observations in this example.


Half of the  large mafic sills show dimensionless  radius smaller than
$R=4$, not consistent with their  arrest in the gravity current regime
(Figure \ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}).   It might  suggest that  these mafic
sills  have  intruded shallower  into  the  crust; for  instance,  for
$d_0=250$ m,  the characteristic  length scale for  the mafic  sill is
smaller   $\Lambda=800$  m   and   $95\%$  of   the  population   show
dimensionless   radius   larger   than   $4$.    Nevertheless,   their
dimensionless  thickness, which  should tend  to a  constant of  order
$O(1)$ according to the model, is  much larger than the expected value
and increases  with the radius  $R$.  For a  gravity current in  a two
dimensional  geometry, the  thickness is  indeed expected  to increase
with the length of the  sill, but as $L^{1/4}$ \citep{Michaut:2011kg},
i.e. with an exponent much smaller  than the value of $0.76$ found for
the    coefficient    $a$    for    large    mafic    sills    (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}, $r^2=0.9$).  Therefore,  the model predictions
hardly reconcile with the observations for large mafic sills.


\subsection{Low-slope domes on the Moon}
\label{C2-sec:observ-vs-pred}

\subsubsection*{Observations}

On the Moon, $13$ elongated  low-slope domes, located around the lunar
maria, have  been recently  identified as potentially  intrusive domes
\citep{Wohler:2007it,Wohler:2009jj}.   \citet{Wohler:2009jj}  used  an
image-based $3D$ reconstruction approach which relies on a combination
of photoclinometry and shape from  shading techniques to determine the
morphometric properties of each of  these lunar domes which results in
a $10\%$  error estimate on  the intrusion thickness. These  data have
since been  updated by Mélanie  Thiriet, an under graduate  student in
our  laboratory,  who  used  the high  resolution  of  the  topography
obtained from  the $64$ ppd, $\sim  450$ m/pixel \citep{Zuber:2009bq},
LOLA  gridded topography  data  to reevaluate  the  thickness and  the
radius  of some  of these  potentially intrusive  lunar domes  (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}).

\subsubsection*{Range of values for the parameters}

Given the basalt composition of most lunar rocks brought back from the
lunar maria by  the Apollo missions, the lunar magmas  are more likely
to be mafic in composition and we  use $\rho_m = 2900$ kg m$^{-3}$ for
the  lava  density.    Intrusion  depths,  which  are   not  given  by
\citet{Wohler:2009jj}, should vary  between $500$ m and $5$  km and in
the following, we set $d_0=1.5$ km for all the lunar domes. Therefore,
on the Moon, the larger lava  density and the smaller gravity leads to
length scale $1.5$ times larger  than terrestrial ones.  For instance,
using $E=10$ GPa  and $d_0 = 1.5$ km, the  characteristic length scale
for a lunar  intrusion is $\sim 5$  km and $3.3$ km  for a terrestrial
laccolith.

The source  of magma in the  lunar interior is poorly  constrained and
more likely to  be deeper than on  Earth; most of the  mare basalt are
thought to be a product of melting initiated deep in the lunar mantle,
deeper than $400$ km \citep{Shearer:2006gg}.  Using the same value for
the initial driving pressure, $\Delta P = 50$ MPa, unless lunar magmas
are  likely to  be  more  mafic and  contain  fewer volatiles  implying
smaller driving pressure, and a depth of $500$ km for the magma source
region,  the  overpressure gradient  is  only  of $100$  Pa  m$^{-1}$.
However, reported  run out distance for  some lava flows in  the lunar
maria are very  large and implies higher effusion rate  than on Earth,
i.e.             $Q_0=10^3-10^8$             m$^3$            s$^{-1}$
\citep{Crisp:1990gf,Zimbelman:1998ww}.  Mare basalts, which have lower
concentration in alkalies than terrestrial basalts, should also have a
lower viscosity \citep{Zimbelman:1998ww}.  We take $\eta_h=1$ Pa s and
for injection rate between  $Q_0=1-10^4$ m$^{3}$ s$^{-1}$, the typical
height scale for lunar domes varies between $0.5$ and $1.5$ m.

\subsubsection*{Predictions versus observations}

After   nondimensionalization,   the   lunar  low-slope   domes   show
dimensionless radius smaller than $4$  consistent with their arrest in
the bending regime (Figure \ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}). In addition, if we
use $Q_0=10$  m$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and  the values of the  parameters listed
above to  calculate the  height scale $H$,  they are  almost perfectly
aligned  with  the  terrestrial  laccolith from  Elba  Island  (Figure
\ref{C2-Corry_Rocchie}) \citep{Michaut:2011kg}.  Indeed,  the best fit
for the power law $h_0=bR^{8/7}$ for all the observations, lunar domes
+  Elba  Island  laccoliths,  is  $h_0  =  103R^{1.14}$  with  a  high
correlation  coefficient $r^2=0.91$.  Given  that  the same  intrusion
depth  has been  arbitrarily chosen  for  all intrusions,  the fit  is
surprisingly  accurate.   Therefore,   the  isoviscous  elastic-plated
gravity current model supports the intrusive origin of the lunar domes
described  by \citet{Wohler:2009jj}  and their  arrest in  the bending
regime.  In  addition, it  is able to  explain the  difference between
Earth laccoliths and lunar intrusive domes \citep{Michaut:2011kg}.

\subsection{What causes the arrest of a shallow magmatic intrusion?}
\label{C2-Toughness}
The  model   shows  promising  results  in   reproducing  the  overall
morphology  of  terrestrial  laccoliths  but  lacks  of  a  predictive
criterion for  their arrest.   Fracturation is generally  considered as
the limiting mechanism for the spreading of magmatic intrusions and in
the following,  we consider fracturation  as a possible  mechanism for
the arrest of magmatic intrusions into the bending regime.

As the flow length increases, the pressure in the intrusion eventually
decreases to  the critical value  equal to the pressure  necessary for
fracturing the  tip. In that case,  fracturing at the tip  might limit
spreading and trigger the arrest of a laccolith in the bending regime.
The  stress intensity  factor  $K_I$ for  a mode  $I$  fracture and  a
uniformly loaded crack situated close to a boundary (i.e., $R \sim d_0$)
can be approximated by \citep{Dyskin:2000iz,Bunger:2005ee}
\begin{equation}
  K_I = K_M M_0 d_0^{-3/2},
  \label{C2-KC}
\end{equation}
where $K_M = 1.932$  is a constant and $M_0$ is  the bending moment at
the crack tip given by
\begin{equation}
  M_0        =        -D       \left.\left(\frac{\partial^2        h}{\partial
        r^2}+\frac{\nu^*}{r}\frac{\partial                     h}{\partial
        r}\right)\right|_{r=R(t)}.
  \label{C2-moment}
\end{equation}
Once $K_I$ reaches the fracture toughness limit $K_c$, which is in the
range  $\sim 1-10$  MPa m$^{1/2}$  for crustal  rocks and  a mode  $I$
fracture \citep{Lister:1991ut},  fracturing at the tip  will limit the
lateral extent of the intrusion.

Injecting the  dimensional scaling  law for the  thickness $h_0$  as a
function of the radius $R$ (\ref{C2-Hr}) into the predicted flow shape
in the  bending regime (\ref{C2-IntrusionShape}) gives  the flow shape
as a function of the radius $R(t)$ of the laccolith
\begin{equation}
  h(r,t) = 0.6 H^{8/7} \Lambda^{-8/7} R(t)^{8/7}\left(1-\frac{r^2}{R^2(t)}\right)^2.
\end{equation}
Injecting this expression into (\ref{C2-moment}) and (\ref{C2-KC}) and
inverting  for  the radius,  one  can  then  found that  the  critical
dimensionless  radius  for a  fractured-limited  flow  in the  bending
regime is
\begin{equation}
  R_{cr} \sim \frac{0.4 E^{7/6} H^{4/3} K_{m}^{7/6}}{K_{c}^{7/6} \Lambda^{7/3}} d^{7/4},
\end{equation}
which, in terms of the parameters, reads
\begin{equation}
  R_{cr} \sim 2.2 E^{7/12}K_{m}^{7/6} Q_{0}^{1/3} \eta_h^{1/3} g^{1/4} \rho_m^{1/4}}K_{c}^{-7/6},
\end{equation}
and therefore mainly depends on the fracture toughness of the encasing
rocks.  On can calculate that for typical crustal and magma parameters
for terrestrial laccoliths  (Section \ref{C2-sec:appl-earth-moon}) and
the largest experimental reported value for the parameter $K_c=10$ MPa
m$^{1/2}$, the dimensionless critical radius is equal to $\sim 60$ and
therefore, still much larger  than the dimensionless transition radius
between  the bending  and  gravity regime  $R=  4$.  Therefore,  while
fracturation might explain  the arrest for large mafic  sills, it does
not provide a sufficient mechanism for the arrest of laccoliths.

\subsection{Discussion}
\label{C2-sec:discussion-1}

Historical models for intermediate  scale magmatic intrusions consider
that  the main  phase  of  laccolith growth  and  spreading require  a
two-stage process: horizontal spreading of a sill followed by vertical
inflation  when the  sill has  grown horizontally  enough so  that the
magma has enough leverage on the overlying layer to begin to bend them
upward \citep{Johnson:1973ho,Koch:1981if}.  More recent models instead
proposed that  these intrusions form  as a series  of sub-horizontally
staked magma  sheets \citep{Morgan:2008hj,Menand:2011ki}.   While both
models are able  to account for several  geological observations, they
both lack a physical description of the intrusion process and are then
not  able  to explain  the  solidified  morphology of  these  magmatic
intrusions in terms of flow parameters (injection rate, volume) at the
time of emplacement.

\citet{Michaut:2011kg}  has   developed  a   new  approach   to  model
intermediate-scale intrusions such as  sills, laccoliths or bysmaliths
through a dynamic elastic-plated  gravity current model that considers
both the bending and the own weight  of the magma as driving the flow.
This model shows promising results in predicting the variety of shapes
of  intermediate scale  magmatic intrusions;  from the  dome shape  of
laccolith to the disk-like morphology  of large mafic sill.  It allows
relating the  laccolith morphology to the crustal  and magma physical
properties,  and  more  importantly,   to  the  injection  rate.   The
prediction of the  model, especially the exponent of  the thickness to
radius  power  law relationship,  also  fits  the variability  in  the
laccolith  units  at  Elba  Island, hence  providing  for  a  physical
explanation for  the observed laccolith morphology.   In addition, the
model is also  consistent with a two-stage growth  process; first, the
lateral  growth   of  a  sill   and  then,  when  the   conditions  of
applicability   for   the   model   are   met,   i.e.    $R>h_0$   and
$R  \gtrsim  d_0$,  spreading   and  thickening  occur  simultaneously
\citep{Michaut:2011kg}. Finally, the model  shows promising results in
explaining the discrepancy between terrestrial laccoliths and low-slope
lunar domes.  Therefore,  it can be  used to  assess the
intrusive origin of intrusive candidates on other terrestrial planets.

However, other questions  remain open.  First, we have  shown that the
model  hardly accounts  for  the  absolute final  value  for both  the
thickness and the  radius of these laccoliths  and that reconciliating
predictions and observations requires abnormally high magma viscosity.
In addition,  we show  that the  model does  not offer  a satisfactory
explanation for the increase in  large mafic sill thickness with their
diameter. Finally,  we also  show that fracturation  is not  likely to
stop  a magmatic  intrusion in  the bending  regime. Therefore,  other
mechanisms,    not   taken    into    account   in    the   model    of
\citet{Michaut:2011kg},   are  required   to   understand  the   final
morphology of these magmatic intrusions.

\section{Towards   a  more   realistic  model   for  shallow   magmatic
  intrusions}
\label{C2-sec:discussion}

In this  manuscript, we  propose to  explore two  important mechanisms
that have  been neglected until  now and will certainly  influence the
emplacement of shallow magmatic intrusions in the crust of terrestrial
planets: the effect of a temperature-dependent rheology for the magma and
the effect of an overburden characterized by a non-constant thickness.

The former has already shown important implications for the cooling of
lava                                                             domes
\citep{Bercovici:2007vc,Bercovici:1996uu,BALMFORTH:1999ey,Garel:2014era}. Indeed,
the viscosity of magma can vary by several orders of magnitudes during
cooling \citep{Anonymous:CZVBrBvv,Lejeune:1995fc}. As the fluid cools,
its composition  and crystal content  change which, in  turn, modifies
the viscosity and the dynamics of  the flow itself.  The first part of
the manuscript deals with this matter and try to better understand the
dynamics of a cooling  elastic-plated gravity current.  In particular,
in  chapter   $3$,  we  propose  a   model  for  the  cooling   of  an
elastic-plated gravity current  with a temperature-dependent viscosity
and  isothermal  boundary  conditions.   This model  is  next  further
refined to account  for the heating of the wall  rocks and compared to
the observations in chapter $4$.

The second  part of the manuscript  addresses the second point  and in
particular, the problem of crater-centered intrusions with application
to  the  endogenous  deformations observed  at  lunar  floor-fractured
craters.   Indeed, these  impact craters  on the  Moon show  important
deformations that  might be  related to the  emplacement of  a shallow
magmatic intrusion below  their floor \citep{Schultz:1976kt}.  Chapter
$5$  presents  the  theoretical  model  and  its  application  to  the
deformations observed  at floor-fractured  craters. Then,  chapter $6$
takes the study of floor-fractured craters one step further by looking
at the gravitational signature of lunar floor-fractured craters in the
light of the model predictions.

This thesis,  closely combining  theoretical models  and observations,
expands and generalizes the model of \citet{Michaut:2011kg} exposed in
this  chapter, and  sheds light  on  the final  morphology of  shallow

The  topographic   deformations  that  could  be   caused  by  shallow
intrusions can  be constrained by observations  of planetary surfaces;
that  is, volume,  shape and  other  dimensions of  intrusions can  be
quantified. In this  thesis, we show that these  observations, used in
combination with a  model for the intrusion dynamics,  can provide the
basis  of an  effective  framework to  study  and constrain  intrusive
magmatism on terrestrial planets.

\section{Lunar intrusive magmatism}
\label{sec:terr-intr-magm}

\subsection{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

While  it provides  important constraints  on the  Moon's thermal  and
petrogenetic evolution,  the total  volume of  melt produced  into the
Moon interior is  poorly known.  Indeed, although  the total extrusive
volume is quantified  through analyses of the lunar  maria, the volume
of intrusive  magma, which should be  large due to the  low density of
the lunar crust,  remains unknown. A first step  in the quantification
of the  intrusive activity  on the  Moon is  the detection  of shallow
magmatic systems.

In this thesis, we focus on  two proposed candidates for shallow lunar
magmatic intrusions:  low-slope domes and floor-fractured  craters. In
Chapter  \ref{Heating}, we  first  show that  morphology of  low-slope
domes is indeed consistent with  their intrusive origin.  Adapting the
model  of elastic-plated  gravity  current model  to  account for  the
crater depression,  we then  show in  Chapter \ref{C5-chap6}  that the
deformations observed  at floor-fractured craters are  also consistent
with the emplacement of magmatic intrusions below their floor.

Upon cooling and solidification,  crater-centered intrusions should be
denser than the surrounding medium and leave a positive anomaly in the
lunar gravity field.  Using the  intrusion morphology deduced from the
model, the lunar gravity field  obtained from the NASAâ€™s GRAIL mission
and topographic  data obtained  from the LOLA  instrument, we  show in
Chapter  \ref{chap7} that  their  gravitational  signatures is  indeed
larger that the one of  normal impact craters. In particular, measured
gravity anomalies at floor-fractured  craters imply an average density
contrast between the magma and the surrounding crust close to $900$ kg
m$^{-3}$. Given  the $12\%$  porosity of the  lunar crust  revealed by
GRAIL, such  density contrast implies relatively  unfractured magmatic
intrusions.   In particular,  it  suggests that  these intrusions  are
sufficiently young to  have escaped the period  of intense bombardment
following the Moon formation.

Around  $10$ low-slope  lunar  domes and  about $200$  floor-fractured
craters have been detected at the  lunar surface, most of them located
close  or within  the lunar  maria. While  the total  volume of  these
magmatic intrusions should not exceed $1\%$ of the lunar maria volume,
it advocates the  presence of numerous shallow  magmatic intrusions in
the lunar crust.

\subsection{The origin of magmas}
\label{sec:crust-magm-intr}

In Chapter  \ref{C5-chap6}, we claim  that the absence  of deformations
surrounding floor-fractured craters suggests  that the unload pressure
associated with  the crater depression  might have driven  magma ascent
below these craters. However, the  unload pressure associated with the
depression should decrease rapidly with  depth on a length scale equal
to   the   crater   diameter,    i.e.    some   tens   of   kilometers
\citep{Pinel:2000wa}. Hence,  the depression caused by  the impact can
drive magma flow  if the magma is already present  on a similar length
scale, i.e. within the crust. The presence of numerous floor-fractured
craters  thus  raises  the  question of  deeper  and  larger  magmatic
reservoirs within the lunar crust at the time of their formation.

This idea is also supported by recent works on rift volcanism on Earth
showing that a depression can play a crucial role in the trajectory of
magma  on the  local  scale \citep{Maccaferri:2014ft}.   Specifically,
\citet{Maccaferri:2014ft} show  that the graben depression  favors the
formation  of a  stress  barrier  at depth  which  might prevent  dyke
propagation depending  on its  nucleation depth. In  particular, dykes
nucleated deep  below the graben will  tend to be deviated  from their
vertical  trajectory  and  produce   off-rift  volcanism.   A  similar
investigation in  a lunar  setting might  also demonstrate  that dykes
initiated deep within  the lunar mantle should have  been deviated off
the crater depression. 

Together, it sustains the idea of shallower magma reservoir within the
lunar crust  feeding these intrusions. Such  magmatic reservoirs might
also have  let a signature in  the lunar gravity field  which might be
detectable through GRAIL.

In the end,  a detailed analysis of the stress  field below the crater
depression  might  be the  natural  extension  of  our work  on  lunar
intrusive magmatism. In addition, it  might explain why these craters,
apart from  the underlying  low density  breccia, provide  a favorable
environment for magmatic intrusions.

At a regional scale, it could also be fruitful to investigate the link
between  the  load  of  the   lunar  maria  and  the  distribution  of
floor-fractured craters, which are mainly located on its margin.

\subsection{Constraining the thickness of the lunar maria}
\label{sec:thickn-lunar-maria}

Approximately $16\%$ of the Moon's surface is covered by basaltic lava
flows  that comprise  the lunar  maria. Although  the total  extent of
these lava  flows is  known, their thicknesses  are more  difficult to
constrain \citep{Thomson:2009eo}. Many  approaches, including indirect
techniques  such  as  gravity,  seismic   or  radar  data,  or  direct
measurements,  through   analyses  of  impact  that   have  completely
penetrated   the  maria,   have  been   proposed  to   estimate  their
thicknesses. Numerous low-slope domes  and floor-fractured craters are
located in the  lunar maria. The underlying  magmatic intrusions might
have intruded  the base of the  basalt layer, which is  more likely to
behave as a coherent elastic layer.  In such case, the model developed
in this thesis can help put  constraints on the thickness of the maria
in  these  locations  as  shown in  Section  \ref{C5-Depth}.   If  the
intrusion has  intruded the maria, it  would at least provide  a lower
bound estimate.

\section{Probing intrusive magmatism on other terrestrial planets}
\label{sec:other-terr-plan}

\citet{Michaut:2013dr}  have already  used the  elastic-plated gravity
current  model  to assess  the  intrusive  origin of  several  Martian
domes. As proven on the Moon,  floor-fractured craters are also a good
basis  to  study  intrusive  processes. While  they  have  first  been
observed and  described on the  Moon, several pieces of  evidence show
that  floor-fractured   craters  might   be  a  common   landscape  on
terrestrial planets.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Mars}:  On mars,  almost $200$  floor-fractured craters,
  located mostly along  a narrow band south of  the dichotomy boundary
  in Arabia Terra, have also been reported \citep{Bamberg:2014hb}. The
  observed deformations within these craters are very similar to those
  observed on the Moon, though Martian floor-fractured craters tend to
  exhibit  a  more  extensive   and  wider  fracture  network  (Figure
  \ref{C7-FFCOther}  a,  b  and  c). This  is  attributed  to  complex
  interactions between the magmatic  intrusion and potential ice/water
  in the subsurface \citep{Sato:2010ex,Bamberg:2014hb}. In particular,
  the  melting  of the  water  (or  possibly  CO$_2$) trapped  in  the
  subsurface   would   enhance   erosion  of   the   floor   fractures
  \citep{Sato:2010ex}.

  Interestingly, the  deformations on Martian  floor-fractured craters
  are not localized within the crater wall but can also extend further
  the crater  rim (Figure \ref{C7-FFCOther}  b,c).  As opposed  to the
  Moon, the overpressure driving the  intrusion might have been larger
  than  the unloading  pressure  associated with  the depression.   In
  addition,  Martian   magmas,  at  the  difference   of  their  lunar
  counterparts,  are most  likely buoyant  until the  surface and  the
  mechanisms  favoring crater-centered  intrusions on  Mars are  still
  debated. Again  on Mars, studying  the stress field  associated with
  the crater  depression could provide  a viable mechanism  to trigger
  magma spreading at depth below these craters.

\item   \textbf{Mercury}:    \citet{Schultz:1977ec}   propose   several
  candidates  searching for  intra-crater dark  haloes or  other color
  variations  indicating post-impact  emplacement  of mafic  materials
  onto the floor. They revealed several crater floors with contrasting
  deposits,  and  additionally  a  few  rimmed  moat-like  depressions
  (Figure \ref{C7-FFCOther}  d). More recently, data  from the MErcury
  Surface,  Space ENvironment,  GEochemistry, and  Ranging (MESSENGER)
  spacecraft  have confirmed  that  vents and  deposits attributed  to
  explosive volcanism occur within  numerous impact craters on Mercury
  \citep{GillisDavis:2009cd,Head:2009ia,Kerber:2009dz}.   While  these
  craters do not show any floor fractures, they might also witness the
  presence of shallow  magmatic intrusions in the crust  of Mercury as
  proposed by \citet{Thomas:2015tt}.

\item \textbf{Venus}: Venus geologic records have been largely cut off
  by  resurfacing events  constantly reworking  the Venusian  surface.
  Nevertheless,  several candidates  for floor-fractured  craters have
  also been proposed on Venus by \citet{Wichman:1995ju}.
